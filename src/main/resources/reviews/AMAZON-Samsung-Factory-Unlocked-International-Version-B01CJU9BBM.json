There are days when I just can not use it and many others work fine. I contacted Amazon and they told me that it was out of the 30 day warranty but that IÂ¨ll should go to a Samsun Center for the 1 year warranty. I did it and as I live in Ecuador, South America, I took it to the authorized center and they told me that the problem should be that it has to be update, it but they could not do it because the phone is from Egypt !! And that only in the place of origin it can be done!!So when they buy a phone notice of which zone it is.Sold by: Wireless Place.Now in March 2017 the  cell phone stopped working. For having been bought on Amazon it  had no Samsung warranty and as the damage occurred after the first 3 months, Amazon also did not take responsibility.

In a couple of months USB slot stopped working, so I could only charge it wirelessly. Then the device started warming up sometimes to a point it was difficult to hold it in your hand, and then going into restart cycles. I contacted the seller and was told they only provide 30 days return policy, which is reasonable. What I was shocked about is when I contacted Samsung support I was told they can't help me with an international version and I have to contact the seller. They basically refused to be liable for the product they manufactured. I had to buy another phone and have a useless piece of technology worth $600 at home, don't know what to do with it. Will probably have to throw it away eventually. The repair shops say to get to the USB slot they have to remove the screen which according to Samsung manual can't be removed without damaging it, so they give me 50/50 chance they can remove it without cracking. But since now it's completely unusable may be I could give it a try.","rating":1},{"id":"R2RDTMETNX3DVV","title":"Be aware, scam","text":"This phone is a mess.

While this is an international version of the phone, it works extremely well.  We have no issues with service what so ever.  My husband set up the phones before taking them in to get the sim cards switched over.  Both had a direct update from Samsung to Android 7.0 that had to be downloaded, and installed.  On Wifi the download was very quick, and it was all done and installed in less than 30 minutes.  Gorgeous phone with glass front and back, and while my husband finds the edge apps annoying i love them.  I think its just the way he holds the phone.  We both love the battery life.  He is into an online only game, and now he can play through his 4 accounts and still has over 65% battery life left and that is going on them multiple times a day.  I have my wifi and data on all the time, and my phone has serious use through the day, and i have usually about 45% battery life left at the end of the day.We purchased the actual Samsung portable chargers for this, the little circles you just lay your phone on, and don't have to plug in the mini usb cord.

Just a small disclaimer: I truly think this is the best phone on the market with the best camera.Reasons to buy an international version:  - You're not SIM locked to any carrier, and can use your phone on any compatible GSM provider, even ones outside the US.  - Major software updates will likely be available to you sooner than carrier-branded US S7 edge models.  - No carrier bloat apps - my unlocked S7 Edge has a full 1.5GB more available storage than my husband's AT&T-branded version and over 2GB more than the Verizon version of my colleague!  - Prices are MUCH cheaper for international versions.Reasons not to buy an international version:  - You'll have to work directly with Samsung or a 3rd party warranty provider (e.g., the retailer) in the event you need to take advantage of the warranty - that could mean shipping, waiting, and dealing with a lot of unknowledgeable service reps. A carrier phone can just be taken to the carrier store, and often can be replaced on the spot if it's faulty.  - Worse battery life and somewhat worse performance versus the Snapdragon versions.  - You lose support for things like Wi-Fi calling, VoLTE, wideband voice, and some other carrier-specific features, potentially. At least for the time being (this could possibly change in the future, but I wouldn't count on it.)  - Samsung Pay doesn't work, and may not ever.  - These phones do not and will not ever work on Verizon or Sprint.Considering all this, I would never buy an International version again. Looking forward to buy a new S8 Edge later this month.","rating":3},{"id":"R3HFT0R81BHRH4","title":"Bad choice","text":"Very unhappy about the edge, miss touch all the time cause when you hold it, you are touching the edge which is super sensitive.The camera lens got broken by itself.

Now there are a few differences between the US and International versions for starters you will recieve a Internationl style plug which does not work in the US, Samsung pay is none existent and cannot be downloaded and it lacks a large majority of the US bands so this phone may not be compatible with your network, I live in the LA using Cricket and havent had any reception/internet issues whatsoever.(should work just fine with At&t as well) Besides the cons this phone includes a much better processor then the US, has better battery life, doesnt get as hot and reportedly has better Audio. In contrast the US's 820 snapdragon processor can play games better but is much slower when loading, switching threw applications and overall general use.This phone is overall extremely quick and everything I've come to expect from the Galaxy s6 and then some.

It's smooth, it's fast, and its pretty to look at and hold. I received a 'United Arab Emirates' version. It is unlocked and works perfectly with my Cricket service, (AT&T network).  One big plus I noticed is network connection speed, on my previous phone, a Xperia Z3+ it was ok but could have been better, and I thought it was just my general location and the fact I am on Cricket which piggybacks on AT&T. With the S7 Edge connection is noticeably quicker and using a speed test app my download speeds are consistently @ 7-8Mbps with even just 1 bar signal 4G LTE, Crickets' throttled limit. Signal reception is also stronger on the S7 Edge in my home than any phone I have had before and I have had quite a few, (H+ and 4G LTE).  It is physically smaller than an iPhone 6s Plus I tried for a short period but it has the same display size, and It's a lot easier to operate 1 handed the the large iPhone.  So far, (after 10 days of heavy use), I like it better every day as it keeps on performing even as I install and use my many apps. The Nougat upgrade has been available for a few days already and I will be upgrading it soon. I will update my review after upgrading to Nougat.**Update** I installed the Nougat update yesterday, (02-21-17). No issues installing, I just let it do it's thing and it took probably 20-30min. Everything works as it should and it has lots of new features, still discovering some of them. No issues so far. I would say it is as fast and smooth as it was before the update if not better.

The big one for me was how hot the phone got. For just using google Maps, to even playing Pokemon go for a little bit in the park, the phone got so hot I could barely hold on to it. I couldn't even imagine using this with a case on it might melt. Then when the phone detects that it gets too hot then it makes that big beautiful display lowers it brightness to where I can not see in the daylight anymore. I am having a lot of issue with it in the Sun.I have heard of these issues with other Samsung phones. Maybe its just the ones with this certain processor, I am unsure if the SnapDragon ones have this issues but the reason I got the international is that it could go to any carrier more or less and I could get the added performance of the Exynos Processor. Turns out it was a bad idea and the phone got so unreasonably hot that I could barely hold on to it. The phone also got noticeably slower as it got hotter. Probably because the processor was limiting itself.Maybe this could be fixed with a software update but I think this is more of a hardware issue. Maybe I just got unlucky and got a defective phone as i don't see many other people mentioning these problems. I do not blame Samsung or have any bad feelings for them.

For starters, the one I got was the english edition for the Saudi Arabia market (see attached photos, the guides came in english and arabic). From what I can tell, the phone is the same as any other international edition but with different preinstalled apps. Mine came with a SA region specific app \"Shaid\" (seems to be a YouTube-esque app in arabic) that I uninstalled and WhatsApp. Other than that the only remaining bloatware was stock Samsung apps (no carrier apps, thank god), the only other thing I noticed that may be region specific is the S Planner app has a \"Hijri dates adjustment\" setting. Lastly this version ships with a non-us wall charger (aside from the regular stock accessories) shown in my review images. Mine also came with an adapter for use within the U.S., I have tried it and can confirm that it works with fast charging.This phone also uses a different chipset (manufactured by Samsung, called Exynos 8890) than the U.S. version. Reviews I read noted that the phone was actually optimized for this chipset w/ better performance and battery life than the U.S. Qualcomm counterpart (Google it). In the U.S. version the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip is used to support Verizon and Sprint customers whereas this version only supports GSM carriers.To preface the review of the actual use of the phone, I have owned the following devices and used them each as a daily driver for at least a months time: Samsung Galaxy S4 GPE, Samsung Galaxy S5, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, HTC One M8 GPE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P. The Galaxy S7 Edge has been the most delightful experience of the bunch. I won't go into great detail here but the camera is phenomenal and launches faster than any other phone I've owned w/ a double tap of the home button. The camera's auto focus is super fast and I feel like I'm able to get a capture a lot of moments that my previous phones were too slow to shoot. It's also nice to be able to change the quick launch apps on the lock screen, I have the dialer and snapchat as mine.Continuing a theme of high performance this phone is incredibly fast despite powering a QHD resolution screen. Apps are surprisingly quick to load and multitasking is a breeze (I even found some use in the Samsung's split screen feature). The fingerprint scanner is on par with apple devices (and nexus 6p/5x) although because of it's non-circular shape I find that I place my finger the wrong way more often. The battery is the best of any device I've used as a daily driver, I've been able to get through days of heavy usage like today (unplugged from charger at 5:45am, now at 25% at 9:03pm).The screen is BEAUTIFUL. Not only is it easy to read even in direct sunlight (something I have seen other devices struggle with) but the colors are vibrant and the screen is huge without making the phone too big or bulky. Perfect for watching YouTube videos and browsing instagram.Lastly a few notes if you buy this phone:- If you're not a fan of the stock Samsung launcher you can get the Google Now launcher from the Play Store, it's the same one used on Nexus devices and feels smoother than Samsung's launcher.- This time around Samsung decided to give you bigger icons which drove me nuts, search for \"Get more on your Galaxy S7, S6 or Note 5 screen with hidden DPI scaling settings\" from Android authority to get a 5th column on the home screen and smaller UI elements.- \"Edge functionality\" is just okay. The feature feels a bit less than polished because of the weak offerings in the Samsung app store - I have it turned off.Edit 4/8/2016: sorry about the quality of the photos of the actual phone - they were shot with the wide angle lens of my GoPro whereas the other images were shot with the S7 Edge.Edit 4/10/2016: added some higher quality images from my new camera.Update 5/9/2016: I've been using the phone as a daily driver for over a month now. I'm still impressed by the overall gfx smoothness, how fast apps load, and camera performance.Update 7/25/2016: still in love with this phone. I'm honestly not sure what would compel me to purchase a new phone at this point.. I also rooted the phone and changed the emojis to the iOS 9 set with the Emoji Switcher app from the play store. No more guessing when messaging my iOS friends =)A lot of commenters have asked which seller I purchased mine from: Wireless Everything.","rating":5},{"id":"RMKOOXTFS1RIR","title":"Fine Print Fiasco","text":"I purchased this phone for the expressed purpose of developing VR projects for Gear VR and Google Cardboard. I never expected or intended to use the phone features of the device. So I never added a SIM card much less carried it around or away from my office. After a couple of weeks the OS seemed to have crapped out and got itself stuck on some green terminal looking boot screen. Despite all my attempts to force a restart, perform a system restore, drain/charge the battery or whatever Android lets you do by holding in button X while closing one eye and whistling a happy tune, the phone just won't get past that Bootloader exception screen.I'm not an Android guy and since the purpose of the phone was to test apps, the device was required to be as close to stock as possible to adequately replicate the experience someone might have on their own device. By that I mean I didn't \"root\" the phone or mess with the OS beyond letting Android run all those auto updates it seems to do on a daily basis.I contacted Samsung US support and they said my phone didn't exist as far as they were concerned because it was obviously an international device. They told me to determine the country of origin and arrange service there.How convenient.I looked for some type of local resource that can service phones but it appears all that can be done are screen or battery replacements. Anything heavier has to go to the manufacturer...in Spain...or Antartica...or the Moon.I contacted the Amazon Marketplace vendor (Mobiles International LLC) that I purchased the phone from and they we nice enough in their correspondence and said:\"Unfortunately Samsung does not provide warranty service on international unlocked phones. If you sent it to us in Miami, we can get a quote from a Samsung authorized service center to get the phone repaired. It looks like a software issue and should be fixable.\"I FedEx'd them the phone and waited and waited. After two weeks or so I sent them an email wondering if there was any update.\"At this time we have not received a quote unfortunately, the Samsung repair center here cannot repair your device because it is not Latin. We have one other option that we are trying. We will contact you as soon as we get a response.\"And waited and waited...till about a month and half had passed and got this:\"We received the unit back from Samsung this week. They returned the unit saying the warranty was void. We have shipped back to your address yesterday.\"Huh? Is Samsung saying that I dropped it in a toilet? Or that I used my considerable phone hacking skills to circumvent their awesome software and install my own custom OS? No idea.So the lesson being, read the fine print. International unlocked phones may or may NOT come with a warranty. And even if you work yourself past that little detail and decide to roll the dice...if something goes wrong with your device there appears to be no recourse to have it repaired.Even if you expect to pay for said repair because the assumption being that a repair would cost less than the cost of a new phone there doesn't seem to be any reasonable way to facilitate getting it fixed. Waiting weeks and weeks to get some vague note about the warranty being void is hardly a workable solution.","rating":1},{"id":"R3GZW4XSNTLYAG","title":"Hello, 3 weeks ago a vertical line apeared in ...","text":"Hello, 3 weeks ago a vertical line apeared in the screen of the Celphone.I live in Argentina, What can I do?Pls see attached photo","rating":3},{"id":"RUYFPJ1DVMVN0","title":"I regret getting this phone!!!!","text":"Getting a green screen (or even purple )every now and then till it completely stay like that forever is a common problem for S7 edge.

Every time it comes with USPS there's always issues.But whatever, I open the box and see that everything was in a plastic bag. I noticed that there's a plug converter so I knew that my phone didn't have a normal plug. I was hoping I would get one, because some of the questions and reviews I read made it seem like they send you the right plug depending where you live. Maybe I just misunderstood, or it's the company I bought it from. I thought it was really nice for them to provide a converter even though I was planning on buying a new plug if it didn't come with the right one. Sadly the one that was sent to me doesn't work.My box was sealed so I was happy about that. But when I check the back it's all scratched up, even when I remove the plastic protector thing.

The repair shops say to get to the USB slot they have to remove the screen which according to Samsung manual can't be removed without damaging it, so they give me 50/50 chance they can remove it without cracking. But since now it's completely unusable may be I could give it a try.","rating":1},{"id":"R3JY0I367AJEYK","title":"Came with broken seal, all ok.","text":"The seal was broken.
