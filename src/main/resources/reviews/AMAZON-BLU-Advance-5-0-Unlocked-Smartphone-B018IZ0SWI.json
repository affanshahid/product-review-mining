Overall, I have been satisfied with my purchase. I inserted my sim (AT&T), booted up and immediately got a signal. It sensed all the data on my sim card that I also installed. While there is an easy learning curve, and it isn't as refined as some of the top end phones being sold, for under a hundred bucks it is hard to beat. I would recommend this phone, just don't expect it to be the latest Samsung or IPhone. It will provide you with talk, text, data and allow most of the functions of the other phones. It doesn't have a lot of built in memory, so plan on using a sim card. They are cheap enough. Camera and speaker are just OK. For my needs, it does the job just fine.","rating":4},{"id":"R1ZDG82BU5RD14","title":"Not a bad phone at all.","text":"I bought this phone just to see what it was about.

In the end, I stayed with my iPhone, as I expected, but I may give this to my young daughter. If they made a device with more storage, there's a good chance I would use it instead. iPhones are way overpriced, and the fact that this $59 phone was embarrassingly close in build quality and speed says a lot about the true costs of cell phones.","rating":4},{"id":"R8N4QW83CXYSH","title":"Five Stars","text":"Good little phone for the money.

I had an outdated phone that might be laughed at, so this was a huge upgrade without having to spend a fortune.  I just like to talk and text and occasionally browse the news while at work.

I called the manufacturer and was instructed to reset the battery and try it again and it did power up and turn on so maybe this has to be done periodically.  I've only had the phone for about a month, so I don't know if this is a reliable fix.

I ended up dropping the phone. It fell flat face down on concrete floor. The phone looks untouched and has no obvious damage, however, the screen no longer works.

I have blown literally thousands with Apple and Microsoft just to have outdated failed devices with no upgrade options. I'm totally done spending a whole paycheck on  a stupid phone. You should be to if you try out this brand. I'm looking at a newer model right now. Ohh and the brightness thing. Be careful with the manual brightness controls. If you turn it all the way down and auto bright is not enabled..it may be blacked out. Auto bright function saved my phone I simply made the \"retina\" detect different lighting after accidentally throwing the brightness all the way down. Hence keep auto bright on when using the slider, Or use the \"settings\" widget and use the \"brightness toggle button\" and never touch the slider..atleast be very careful about the darkest setting.

Alright","text":"Amazing phone!Alright, so I'm somewhat new to the phone scene and my previous phone was an iPhone 4s. But this phone feels amazing.First off the phone feels really sturdy and the materials are really nice to touch. Compared to an iPhone 4s the phone is HUGE, its slightly larger than my friends iPhone 6.The specs in the phone are nothing special but get the job done. For gaming you will usually see 30 ish fps on most games (that just what it looks like, could be something different). The 1GB of ram means that once you tap out of an app you will probably have to reload it.The case fits very nicely and doesn't feel too bulky either. The earbuds are usable but I would recommend getting new ones as these sound very damp and weak. The screen protector is very smooth but does have a few small air bubbles near the edge of the phone (make sure you clean the phone screen before putting on the screen protector to minimize air bubbles!)The screen itself is very nice. When looking at it VERY close you can see a few ity bity pixels but if it is a foot away you probably wont be seeing the individual pixels. I'm using AT&T and all I had to do  was put the sim card in. The phone has two sim card slots (micro sim and full sim) so if you have an phone with a nano sim card (like an iPhone 5) you will need either an adapter or a new card altogether.My biggest criticism of this phone is the storage. This phone 8GB of storage but only ~4GB of it is usable. After downloading a few games and a lot of music it got filled up. So what I recommend doing is getting a 16-64GB micro SD card https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-microSDHC-Standard-Packaging-SDSQUNC-032G-GN6MA/dp/B010Q57T02/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1472489110&sr=1-4&keywords=microsd%2Bcard (this phone can take up to 64GB of micro SD storage).","rating":4},{"id":"RCYYDVE4EL746","title":"Good phone for the price paid","text":"I purchased this phone for my preteen son and he really likes it.

The touch screen is bright and very responsive. The graphics on his games look great. The sound is pretty good, not great. The LCD screen is not very durable; it cracked a bit after being dropped not from very high up at all, but it was still fully functional anyway. The camera is okay. The photos come out pretty nice as long as the lighting is good. Low light photos are not that great, even with the flash, but that's expected.

I'd use this as a daily driver.Clarification: This review is for the /HD/ model. Specs for the base unit will be a bit lower.The Good: Don't be afraid of this phone's modest underhood specs. It's still capable of handling most common smartphone use cases.Browsing with Mobile Firefox, some Android games, texting, calling, picture taking, are all things I have tested and found rather pleasant.The rear firing speaker is surprisingly powerful and bass-y. Dare I say, sounds better than my Samsung S5!The 720p IPS LCD is another show-stealer. My past three phones have had AMOLED screens, and this phone's panel makes the return to LCD painless.The processor, RAM, and Flash memory are all \"acceptable\" for casual day-to-day use cases, and will tame most social media programs and web browsers without complaining.If its admittedly cramped 8GB of ROM isn't enough for you, drop a high performance SD card in it and enable Android 6.0's Seamless Storage feature. Boom. Major upgrade to your internal storage. (I have tested up to 32GB.)(WARNING: This feature will format and encrypt the memory card, locking it to that specific phone. \"Strange\" things can happen if the card and phone are separated while the feature's enabled, and the card will not work in anything else until reformatted normally.)Dual SIMs make travel painless, if not enjoyable.This phone supports UMTS Band 4, and works on T-Mobile.Build quality and button tactile feel was VERY remarkable for a phone at this price point. The back \"brushed\" panel really is aluminum. You can see contact points in the battery door, where the phone uses it as a conductive plane.They include a basic silicone cover and plastic screen protector right there in the box!The Bad:It's a cheap smartphone. I know I just praised its build quality, but it's imperfect. Mine's back cover will no longer \"latch\" closed all the way around.The touch screen is one painfully obvious place where they skimped to save on the BoM. The digitizer array is horrifyingly low resolution, with obvious \"steps\" when dragging or scrolling. It's still USABLE, but the low resolution can cause a few minor response issues when web browsing or playing games that demand touch precision.Power users will feel the pain of not having premium silicon under the hood.The Meh:Battery: It'll run all day on average use. Heavy users may find themselves reaching for a battery bank before the end of the day.Cameras: The main has 8MPs. You won't feel ashamed sharing its pictures with your Facebook friends, but it won't replace your dedicated point and shoot either. The app launches reasonably quickly. Pitting it against my battle-worn S5, the Blu actually launches slightly faster, but takes longer to close a focus lock. The secondary ... I don't take \"selfies\", but it'll do the job for video calls. My standards for front facing cameras are pretty low.Cellular: This phone is not equipped with an LTE radio - only UMTS HSPA+ 21Mb \"4G\". I don't consider this a deal breaker, because I doubt its modest specs could put the higher bitrate to use...The Ugly:This phone, among other inexpensive phones manufactured in China, were involved in a malware scandal. Afflicted phones shipped with a spyware trojan directly integrated into the over-the-air firmware update program.Blu, who produces some of the stricken phones, claims that all involved phones have had the trojan patched out of them.Google has released a statement demanding that these firmware spywares must be removed from all Android phones equipped with Google Play Store.Adups, who supplies the OTA firmware utility, released a statement that this trojan was never supposed to reach American market phones, and was intended as Chinese market research. Chinese market phones do not ship with Play Store due to censorship.Take from this what you will, and may your purchasing decision be well informed.","rating":4},{"id":"R305RZ9UWEBZEX","title":"Decent phone but terrible camera and very little memory","text":"I brought this phone abroad with me for a few months because it was unlocked and I didn't want to risk having my more expensive phone stolen. Overall, this phone for a backup is a pretty good choice. It works decently and has a good battery life. The reason for the 3 stars instead of 4 or higher is because this phone has so little space for apps on it. You can add an SD card, and I added a 64 gb one thinking that would allow me to install whatever I needed. However, most apps cannot be put onto the SD card and also even apps that can be put either completely or partially install to the phone first and then have to be moved to the SD card which kind of defeats the purpose (there is a setting where you can theoretically have it install to the SD card first, but in my experience it didn't work). 4GB sounds like a good amount of memory but most of it is taken up by junk apps that you can't delete. I currently have a gmail app,google maps,  groupme, whats app, venmo and a pdf reader on my phone (some of which are partially on the sd card) and my phone is completely out of space. Also, theres a few random bugs (might just be my phone though), for example, if i turn brightness on, when my phone goes to sleep the screen will not come back on unless i hard reset it (not a problem though if the brightness is kept off). Also the camera takes really awful pictures (I generally use my phone to take pictures of notes for class, but it is impossible with this phone to do so). Overall though its cheap and works pretty well in doing the basics so if you need a backup I recommend it, but if you want a full time phone, I would not get this one purely because of the lack of space.","rating":3},{"id":"RZWTVSP9FBOX4","title":"So-so phone....!","text":"I had to return the phone in less than a week the phone looks very nice front facing speakers sound good but not stereo .

I've had it since June, 2016.  I use it as a secondary phone and as a hotspot.  The primary shortcoming for me is the inferior focusing / inferior photo's it takes.  My comparable Nokia 635 (pricewise) takes much superior pictures.  This has kept me from switching from the Nokia to it.  Also as far as I have been able to discern, I can't choose where my BLU stores downloaded pics.  If I have the optional SD card in, they default to it.  If no optional SD card is installed it, defaults to phone memory. There are other issues with pics involving DOWNLOAD, GALLERY, AND FILE MANAGER that would take too long to describe here. Overall I find the BLU Android OS less intuitive for me than the Windows OS on Nokia 635 but Window OS (mobile) has some significant IE problems.

There really isn't a way to check before placing the order with Amazon because it depends on the IMEI number on each phone and many Amazon customer reviews were hit and miss with that info.

I also notice there isnt a lot of bloatware on the devicr.  It only had amazon apps on It and thats it!You can also go into the settings and really do a number on the phones graphics.  Meaning you can shapen the images such a saturation or sharpen.  Its like adjusting your TV, but on a phone.So should you buy this phone?  If you're an Apple or Samsung fan boy you may be pleasantly surprised there are other companies making good phones that don't cost 4 months of pay to buy.","rating":5},{"id":"R1DFSZWOZIHZ2I","title":"Happy with this phone.","text":"This is my first time ordering a phone off the internet, and honestly i'm not disappointed. I was scared it wasn't going to be a good phone considering I saw a lot of bad reviews after I had already ordered it. and like most things people can buy online, its a 50/50 chance you're getting a good quality, or a bad quality item. But I would count myself lucky since this phone seems to be a good quality so far. I have not found any problems with it. It responds fast, and the whole GB is not much, but I did make a purchase on a more spacious SD card. which makes it even better.I so far have only found one thing that slightly bothered me,when I went onto YouTube sometimes the videos go green, and I had to re-enter the video to get it to be normal. Other than that though. this phone is a good phone for this price.","rating":4},{"id":"RIO0RRQ0HJZVW","title":"You can't beat it for the price. You just can't.

It is responsive, and I would consider it perfect if it had an eCompass (if you want to run Astronomy Software to locate Stars and things in the sky in real time, get a different phone since that needs an eCompass for direction). The battery lasts a full day with normal use, but 2 days would be better (or 3 or 4 or 5....<grin>).Here is an update after using the phone for many months.  I still love the phone. I bought a protective case for it since I drop it a lot, and it has hit the ground (asphalt roads) several times and has NOT failed me yet.  BUT, my biggest complaint is LACK OF MEMORY for APPS. 4 GB is just not enough. I have to pick and choose, and even when moving everything out to the SD card that can be moved, I am still short tow apps that really want to load but simply can't do it.","rating":5},{"id":"RY712W2KR7B","title":"Great phone for a low price.","text":"Bought it for my mom due to my dad needing a new phone, he got the blu Advance 5.0 she got the Advance 5.5.

Some might argue its worth paying more for flagship phones or more durable phones, but honestly this one works fine and lasts pretty long. Unless you drop it constantly or don't take care of it properly. Phone isn't top notch, but texting and calling wise it does it's job.

Sometimes when turned off it won't load the Facebook or Messenger app. It's like they are no installed, however, Google Play shows them as installed. Phone re-boots often. Too many times. This is the third time I had to to restart it to factory settings and it didn't not back up my pictures in the sd card even though I asked for.

Work number / personal number setup, instead of carrying two phones around.I like the FM radio it comes with... Such a simple addition why don't $700 phones include it?I like the lack of bloatware preinstalled, I will put the software I want on it thank you very much.Even though it is a cheap $$ phone, it doesn't seem cheap. I've held more expensive phones that felt cheaper.This a transitional phone for me, I don't feel like I wasted money on it...If you are looking to buy a cheap phone to play games you know won't work on a phone at this level, why try? I've dealt with people who need a $2000 computer and try to buy the $100 one to do what they need. They are upset when it doesn't and then badmouth the computer for not working.

I and my parents love the phones so much. They do everything we need and are 1/4 the cost of any other smart phone currently on the market. (It helps that I have not has one blow up like some other phones out there.)Don't get me wrong, if you are looking for the newest high-tech thing-a-ma-bob this is not it. This is a basic smart phone. Battery life is decent if your not running apps constantly and the phone is more then average.  For people on a budget (Aren't we all?) this really is the best you can get for your buck.I've never had an issue with it technical wise. It's user friendly and has a decent screen for easy viewing.NOTE: If you try to play lots of games or apps the phone will overheat. This is it's major flaw: Games will have this phone cooking in no time. However, apps like Pandora or FB seem fine. f this is a major thing for you then look elsewhere for your phone needs. Still, for this price is that is the biggest issue with the item then it's still in pretty good shape.BTW: I only got two phones for myself is because I am brutal with my phones.

I needed something temporary in between my old one breaking and a new one shipping out. This was never intended to be a forever phone.That being said, the phone performed fairly admirably.Pros:- decent battery life for all day use- Dual SIM- Expandable memory- Fairly stock Android, not a lot of bloatware- large screen- decent form factor- Price! Stupid amount of phone for that money.Cons:- dim screen- internal storage is abysmal for what apps want in this day and age. Even with just Google apps, I ran out of room right quick- ran into a boot loop problem twice in the month I used it. Had to factory reset to get it to work again.- Browsing the internet, switching between apps was slow and sometimes choppy.If I was in the same situation I was, I'd probably buy this phone again.

I lost my last phone worth 500.00 and so I am not investing into any phone tath cost that much so this is a great buy and a great add as it does everything that a 500.00 phone does.  It's a prime phone so I get offers and ads but I actually like to see what's out there in products, so it's no hassle.  It's of course loaded with AMAZON apps, but I'ma a amazoner so that's not problemo for me.

I thought this would suit the bill with the dual sim slot which would come in handy for work, but knew that 4GB or Ram wasn't going to be enough, so I installed an 8 GB SD to  help it out.  What this phone lacks is RAM.  Even if you store all the apps to your external SD card like I do,  You will run out of RAM and will get the notification that you must delete something in order to load the program.  Don't expect to load more than a dozen apps on this phone.  With that said, everything is fine. I have another three weeks before the option to return it ends and I have another one coming from Amazon this week.  For a few more dollars, get something with a little more RAM - at least 1.5 GB or more.  This will make a  good back up phone when the need arise.","rating":3},{"id":"R2Z2G83NN1S8S2","title":"If you use lots of apps, don't buy this phone.","text":"It's a nice phone but after using it for the past 7 months, the lack of internal memory and low battery life (even with wi-fi turned off it must be charged daily) is driving me nuts, especially the memory.

I've installed a dictionary (200MB), Dropbox (140MB), Messenger (106MB), Whatapp (50MB) and a few small apps which total less than 100MB and that's it. Full.

My next phone is going to be one of the $200 phones. I can't go on enough about the value of this phone. Just get one for a laugh like I did, thinking I'd have it a month or two till the next line of Samsung comes out...and I just decided to ride it out cause I really don't need the Galaxy for anything besides the camera.The camera on this phone isn't crap but it sure ain't like the $600 phones.

If I want him to follow my GPS then I'll need to restart the app. Sometimes during a 2 hour tour of downtown, I'll have to reload 12-15 times.The latest thing is the wonderful fact that BLU pushed an update. I figured this update would actually fix some issues instead of creating more. \"Blu help - Warranteer notification\"? I don't want to activate my warranty and I don't want to see this notice anymore. Some of my apps use the overlay feature, but with the new update I can't get any pop up notices from Facebook messenger when I have Pokemon GO running (and that's all the time) Also along with Pokemon GO, the battery life _was_ amazing. The update must have added a number of background processes because I'm no longer getting the amount of playtime I once was. Pokemon GO also, now, shuts down unexpectedly...This was a good phone at this price point if AT&T 3G coverage is fast enough. Or if you want a free hotspot. Or if you need less than 15 apps.

I purchased a 16 GB microSD for picture, music and app storage. The only drawback so far is that there are many apps that cannot be moved to the SD card, so if you are app crazy, you may not be happy with the limited system memory space.

Also, after moving apps to the SD card it moves them back the the phone memory after an update, really annoying when it doesn't have much phone memory to start with.All in all, it's a great unlocked phone for the price and if they don't fix the issues above, I guess it is still a great deal","rating":4},{"id":"RAUYII2J8MN11","title":"His is still working fine but I turned mine on today and it went ...","text":"Hubby bought us both one of these on July1st of 2016, I think was the date.

I am a college student and the interface is easy to understand for all ages. The only down sides I've ran into is the device memory and microphone for voice communications. Device Memory is easily filled with apps and cached data, and this is easily fixed via a $10 32 gb mini-sd card. So in this regard, this phone is for the business aspect, not a gaming one. As for voice communications, I get a lot of \"I can barely hear you\" even with my mouth close to the mic. This is mostly due to a case I purchased for the phone, so be mindful when purchasing one. I've used iPhones and high end Samsung devices in the past; and this is easily one of the better phones I've had, even on a budget.","rating":5},{"id":"R32TGJGMXEJ0UQ","title":"Love it arrived in 2 days","text":"Awesome phone didn't realize it only had 4g internal memory but it's awesome,Child I change my mind on this review the black 5.0 worked fine the white one started glitching in 2 days, blank screen, won't charge, keeps shutting down apps, I loved the phone because if size and how it looked but now I regret buying it.

The screen sensitivity is good, but it can be a bit of a pain due to Google Now. I also downloaded a couple of rhythm games and it's simply impossible to play. I recall picking this device because it offered 4GB of internal memory, but I only got 2GB. Lollipop isn't exactly the best, so I've encountered a few annoying bugs like app shortcuts deleted from the homescreen and logging out of twitter and instagram when I turn it off, among others, but other than, it's nice. As a simple smartphone it's good; I haven't found many things I dislike about it. Also, if you use your phone to listen to music from time to time, the speaker is really nice and the sound enhancement works perfectly, but it might be tricky finding headphones that actually work.","rating":3},{"id":"R33UJE2JS180ZU","title":"It came packaged great, with a case","text":"I am extremely impressed with this phone!

It took a bit to get use to the power button on the side but now i actually prefer it there. It runs just as well as an expensive phone, no lag no issues. It does only have 8gb of memory and the system takes up 4gb, so keep that in mind but with my sd card i haven't had any memory issues. If you are looking for an affordable phone that works like an expensive phone, this is it. This phone runs just as well as my lg g4 did and for a hell of a lot less money! If you find my review helpful, Please click on yes, \"was this review helpful to you?\"","rating":5},{"id":"R9IQ5YV8WXW7K","title":"Very smart and economical IMO to include the case and screen ...","text":"For $70 I think you are getting your money's worth.  The phone comes with a case, plastic screen protector, earphones, microUSB cable, and an outlet adapter.  Very smart and economical IMO to include the case and screen protector as even people who are in the market for budget phones will typically have to buy those as well. For the price, or even for double the price, I don't think there are many phones that have much better specs.  The newest version android, quad core 1.3ghz processor, 1gb ram, ~294 pixels per inch, and weighing in at only 142g.I've noticed some reviews saying they had trouble opening the back of the phone to insert the battery. They are right that there are no direct instructions provided for that which certainly should have been included in a start-up manual.  If you look at the phone with the screen towards you, in the top right corner of the phone has a small indent that should allow you to open the back with a low to medium amount of force.The phone itself looks nice and runs pretty smoothly.  I've maybe noticed a slight lag when opening some programs for the first time in a while.  I've also noticed some widgets are not properly responsive if you don't open the program for that widget before hand.  Not sure if that's an issue with the phone itself, the OS, or the apps, though it's likely not the apps.If you have very basic phone needs, this phone is a prime choice especially since you don't have to buy a screen or case.  As for the earphones, I would have gladly paid something like $3 less and not have received those.Also, since there's a Pokemon GO craze going on right now, this phone can play the game but not on the augmented reality mode since I do not believe it contains a gyroscope.I've only had the phone for about five days so I will update the review if my opinions change on it.Edit 1:Have had the phone for almost three weeks now and am still very satisfied with my purchase.  I forgot to mention what carrier I am using.  I am on T-mobile and everything seems to work just fine, even though on the compatibility rating it says \"partial\" coverage for 3G and no coverage for 4G.  I'm sure there is a very technical explanation for all this, but my phone usually tells me I'm on 3G or 4G when I'm not connected to wifi.  Battery life seems to be pretty good.Edit 2:Have had the phone for a month now and still like it a lot.  I am having some issues with the headphone jack, however.  When I plug in my headphones, sometimes it doesn't register to the phone for some reason and while sound comes out of the headphones, it doesn't cancel the sound coming out of the speaker.  I've tested this with multiple pairs of headphones so it seems to be a problem with the outlet.  If I plug the headphones in slowly then it works fine.","rating":4},{"id":"RUJ7X0UIFB9FK","title":"Does what a typical Android phone does but for half the price!","text":"After reading all the reviews about this phone over & over again and weighing my options, I finally purchased the phone and was able to receive it that same day. I had low expectations, assuming that it would have very low quality screen & horrible resolution, horrible camera quality & little to next to none storage --- BUT... when I did a thorough look at the phone it was a very nice decent Android. I assume that the screen would feel like plastic but it's GLASS, nice smooth touch to it. (Since it was hard glass, I quickly ordered a tempered glass screen for protection.) The back cover had a great texture almost imitating leather with a rubber feel to it. I purchased the phone in the color white (It was a nice pure white/clean) so I also bought a case to protect not just the phone itself but the color so that it wouldn't dull over time. I don't take pictures much & Im not too big on downloading apps so the storage issue wasn't bothering me much but I did stick a 16gig SD card in just in case. (I was able to download basic apps like FB, Insta, Snapchat without any issues) Camera quality isn't all that great but it's decent in great lighting or with flash on. (I will insert a picture of my dog taken by the BLU phone) This phone has a not so great battery life, it drains as soon as I unplugged it and started using it. It'll probably only give you a few hours of life if you use it constantly on&off at full brightness. Out in the sun the phone screen can be hard to see too so be aware of that. I was able to compare the phone to my sisters Samsung Prime Core phone and it looked GREAT next to it. It felt lighter than the Samsung & looked as if I paid $100 + for it. It's not the greatest phone if you compare it to the top notch $500 & Plus phones like iPhones, Samsung's Galaxy's & etc but it's great phone to start off your teen kids with. Overall I have to say that I do love this phone for the price range and its 5\" screen size.","rating":5},{"id":"R1OYL0T186QM3S","title":"Good viewing angles","text":"This phone is a unbelievable value.  I've had all Iphone products, Samsung, Nexus 6 etc and this phone is not them.  However, this phone resets the bar on what the others should be.  Will this phone do 99% of what just about every user demands?  Dual sims work flawlessly, runs all the apps in the PlayStore.  You won't be able to just install everything your hearts desire, you'll have to manage storage memory.  There is a slot for a up to a 64 gb card for media and apps that allow you to move them to the SD card, but you'll see that few apps can be moved to SD card anymore (not the phone's fault).  The screen is not HD or Retna but it's 100% acceptable.  Good viewing angles, clear, bright, etc.  I've had phones that had poor displays and you couldn't see the screen if you tilted the phone, this is not the case with this phone.  Battery life is really really good.  I run dual sims (work/personal) and I'm 60% when I go to bed.  Build quality is much better than I expected, very solid.  Call volume is a bit low, but this seems to be a common issue with Android, not the hardware.For $60 you will not be disappointed.  You'll probably wonder what an extra $600 for a high end phone really gives you.My family member also has a Blu phone, different model, and it's been 100% for 1.5 years.  She loves it and laughs when she tells people she paid less than $100 for it.","rating":5},{"id":"RB3JXO1B59XXW","title":"Hit the ground running with this phone!","text":"This device does not have very many reviews like other Blu devices. I have ordered many Blu devices in the past, and most have at least a few hundred reviews. These have been very helpful in allowing me to decide on whether I am interested in the device. So, I will post my review here and offer some insight for those interested.In the box, you receive the typical Blu package: the phone, a power adapter, earbuds, a TPU case and a screen protector. All of these items arrived intact and met all expectations. The screen protector that came with this device had some quirks that some may want to be aware of. Unlike most screen protectors, this one was NOT completely transparent. The screen protector had a special color print for the bezel of the device, covering the white face and replacing it with a rose gold finish. This was fine, except that the size of the print on the screen protector was slightly off, making it very difficult to place the protector without covering the screen or the ports. I was able to get down pretty close, but the added printing made it much more difficult to apply.When installing the battery and SIM, I ran into the same difficulty removing the backplate of the device. Once removed, however, things were easy. Do not let this deter you from purchasing this phone. The phone booted up nicely with a vivid and colorful display and otherwise had 0 issues. A great phone for the price thus far.","rating":4},{"id":"R25ZUN9JYRHRPV","title":"Works great,  Would buy again","text":"Purchased this phone to replace a Samsung Note 1,  yes the original note.  The old phone works fine, but to slow.For the new phone, I wanted something that was unlocked and could handle 2 phone numbers.  Probably the best purchase I've made in a long time.  Phone works great and have used now for several months without issue.  With the new OS, the phone is fast and feature packed.  Don't see a reason to pay 600-700 for a phone when this has the same whistles and bells, which I'll probably never use.The new phone uses a smaller sim, so I stopped at the AT&T store and they gave me a replacement sim (free), I popped it in phone and ready to go.Haven't dropped from 6 feet or dropped it in the sink, or thrown it at one of my kids (yet), but there is always tomorrow.  Would recommend this phone to folks that want a nice phone and is affordable.UPDATE: (Mar 16, 2016) Purchased a second phone for one of the kids and I had concerns about the phone because it was shipped (Amazon shipping) in a box 4x the size of the factory phone box without packing.  So the phone was rattling in the box during shipping.So far the phone is working as designed, but disappointed with the packing by Amazon","rating":5},{"id":"R9L07MEZILKD4","title":"Filled with features, just not filled with storage","text":"For the price, it's amazing. I found very few important flaws in it. I love how it's unlocked, despite it's low price. It comes with Android 5.1 Lollipop, which means I can get most apps. It comes with dual sims and is really quite fast. If it didn't list the brand name on the front of the phone, I'd assume it would be a flagship phone. The quality of the back case is durable and feels really good to touch. I've dropped it plenty of times and it still holds up.However, there's a minor flaw that is very important. The storage is very limited. I have to regularly delete apps and clear the cache because of how I like downloading new apps often. Even with an SD card, it's still very limited due to the fact many apps are not compatible with the SD card.Overall, I believe this is a great phone. While it's limited in storage, you have all the features of a flagship phone and a little more.","rating":5},{"id":"RCYYDVE4EL746","title":"Good phone for the price paid","text":"I purchased this phone for my preteen son and he really likes it.

The touch screen is bright and very responsive. The graphics on his games look great. The sound is pretty good, not great. The LCD screen is not very durable; it cracked a bit after being dropped not from very high up at all, but it was still fully functional anyway. The camera is okay. The photos come out pretty nice as long as the lighting is good. Low light photos are not that great, even with the flash, but that's expected. It does have the front facing camera so that you can Skype and video chat and etc...For the price paid, it's a pretty good phone, especially for someone who wants a decent phone with good speed, memory and features without breaking the bank.","rating":4},{"id":"R21EITC3O0PIGI","title":"Amazing phone! Alright","text":"Amazing phone!Alright, so I'm somewhat new to the phone scene and my previous phone was an iPhone 4s. But this phone feels amazing.First off the phone feels really sturdy and the materials are really nice to touch. Compared to an iPhone 4s the phone is HUGE, its slightly larger than my friends iPhone 6.The specs in the phone are nothing special but get the job done. For gaming you will usually see 30 ish fps on most games (that just what it looks like, could be something different). The 1GB of ram means that once you tap out of an app you will probably have to reload it.The case fits very nicely and doesn't feel too bulky either. The earbuds are usable but I would recommend getting new ones as these sound very damp and weak. The screen protector is very smooth but does have a few small air bubbles near the edge of the phone (make sure you clean the phone screen before putting on the screen protector to minimize air bubbles!)The screen itself is very nice. When looking at it VERY close you can see a few ity bity pixels but if it is a foot away you probably wont be seeing the individual pixels. I'm using AT&T and all I had to do  was put the sim card in. The phone has two sim card slots (micro sim and full sim) so if you have an phone with a nano sim card (like an iPhone 5) you will need either an adapter or a new card altogether.My biggest criticism of this phone is the storage. This phone 8GB of storage but only ~4GB of it is usable. After downloading a few games and a lot of music it got filled up. So what I recommend doing is getting a 16-64GB micro SD card https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-microSDHC-Standard-Packaging-SDSQUNC-032G-GN6MA/dp/B010Q57T02/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1472489110&sr=1-4&keywords=microsd%2Bcard (this phone can take up to 64GB of micro SD storage).","rating":4},{"id":"R2LEMRN3FPOBA5","title":"Great phone for great price","text":"Great phone for great price!!
