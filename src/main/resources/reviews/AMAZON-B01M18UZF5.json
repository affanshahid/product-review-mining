I would not purchase this computer again and, in fact, wish I had returned it. Yes, the screen is really nice, and it's light, and sharp, and has all the aesthetics you'd want in a new laptop. At the end of the day, the viewing angle of this laptop is terrible. The screen does not tilt back far enough to use this well on your lap, unless you are sitting with you legs straight out in front of you. If you like to use your laptop while having your legs propped up on an ottoman or coffee table, chances are pretty good that the screen will be pointing \"downward\" more than you'd like, making it hard to see. I have to modify how I sit in order to use this laptop (as I'm doing now), and it's really annoying. There really is no reason for Asus to have done this -- it's just inconvenient. If you are only going to be using this laptop at a table or desk, then buy this laptop -- it's otherwise great. But if you like to sit with it on a couch or in a chair, it's borderline nonfunctional. Not what I expect from a laptop.

This is Very Annoying!!!  You tell me. Is this a design problem? or is this a defect?My other issue is in the layout of the keyboard function Fn- Volume Control.  Because Volume  control is F10 (mute) F11 (Down) & F12 (Up) -And the Fn Function key is in the far lower left... It takes 2 hands to quickly adjust the audio volume or mute.

I would think in four attempts and four different finger placements, it would be more consistent in recognizing it.  However, the option of using a code is fine since I would rather be safe than sorry.  My one and only issue with it -- and maybe I'm missing something -- is just opening it.

It is a 1080P screen. It has great viewing angle.Track pad: this is one of thr best track pad I ever used. It is a glass trackpad that's why it is very smooth and precise.the fingerprint reader is fast and very responsive, it never failed to respond to my finger.Keyboard: I feel very comfortable using this keyboards. You can even use the keyboard in the dark  because it is backlit and looks amazing. If you want your screen to be super bright just click on fn and A. You can adjust the brightness level of the keyboard or turn the feature off to save battery.Speaker: the speakers sound pretty good, that's exactly what I need in a laptop speaker, Asus did a really great job by collaborating with Harman kardon to deliver those amazing laptop speakers to the customers.Performance: the 7th generation i5 processor in this laptop is super fast, As an Engineering Student, the laptop helps me makes all my computation really fast without any hiccup.The SSD is also fast.The fan noise is not even a problem because it doesn't do it often.Battery: the battery last forever, Asus did an excellent job in that area. You can watch videos for at least 10 hours. You can do web surfing for 11 hours.Conclusion: That's a premium laptop for  the price. Every student should buy this laptop because it looks beautiful,it performs amazingly and you get more for what you pay .The laptop looks more expensive than its actual price.

This little darling was delivered yesterday.  Yesterday evening, I began configuring the system.  It booted up super fast thanks to the SSD drive.The system runs very quiet -- I had read about other people's noisy fan issues.  It installs software quickly and is running very efficiently.I like the weight of the unit (just under 3 pounds) and the sturdy build as well.All in all, at this very initial stage, I say that it is money well spent. Thank you, ASUS!--------------------------------------------------------AFTER SOME TIME WITH THE SYSTEM:My initial impressions are still accurate.  This little tyke really does what I wanted it to do.  It boots up very fast and is very quiet thanks to the SSD drive.  One of the earlier problems I did have with it was something that I saw others had issues with as well:  fingerprint recognition.  Well, I went on line and did a search for ASUS ZenBook fingerprint ID and found something that, quite frankly, I hadn't thought of in my initial problems.  There were a couple of postings suggesting that I use a different finger.  Sure enough, when I used another finger that was not as scraped up as my index finger, the computer recognizes the print on the first try.  Before, I would have to end up entering my PIN because my finger failed out.  Trial and error.  :-)Other than that, the computer has installed all the programs that I wanted to have on it and there have been no issues running any of them.  The installs went very fast.The wireless works extremely well.  It finds anything that is available and connects without a problem.I am still very impressed with this ZenBook and look forward to taking it on vacation with me at the end of April.  I want to see how well it catches the wireless signal on the ship I will be on.  One of the biggest reasons I purchased this computer was for its weight -- or lack thereof -- when traveling.Thank you, ASUS, for such a quality product!","rating":5},{"id":"RN2D7HLG1SN70","title":"Performance, value, and beauty","text":"Truly great looking laptop.

Coming from a laptop that could barely hold a charge for 2 hours, it is amazing to be able to use this all day and barely have less than half my battery left. I use it for lighter tasks during the day - web surfing, word processing, etc.It is powerful. I have mine hooked up to an external dock when I am at my desk at home - there is no lag, issue, or even heat when I am using two screens and a bunch of extra peripherals. When used on its own, just as fast. The i5 is snappy, and noticeably so, and the 8 GB of RAM is more than enough to handle any of the computing needs I have. 256 GB SSD is more than enough to hold everything you need on the go,. Windows 10 runs flawlessly, and the wifi is quick and responsive. Screen is great too - doesnt burn your eyes like the MacBook retina displays do, rather, this screen is soft to look at and shows colors vibrantly.It is so small and light!!! It is smaller, thinner, and lighter than my chromebook, so much that I actually got rid of my chromebook and now exclusively use this. Keyboard is excellent: it is a full keyboard with responsive keys. I am an aggressive typer, but the keys and the laptop handle it well.Finally, it is pretty. Way better looking than any of my friends Macs. The only nicer looking computer I have seen is the ASUS Zenbook 3, with its royal blue and gold. Fingerprint sensor makes other laptop users jealous.

Great little laptop, I love the size and weight. I am giving this laptop a 4 star for two reasons. The first is that the laptop feels and looks cheap. For example, the front part, where you lay your wrists to type, always makes a clicking sound because the pieces that make up the bottom part of the laptop aren't held together with enough screws, so they rub on each other and emit an audible clicking sound.

I'll update as time goes on.My Zenbook came with a Kaby Lake Core i5, 8 gigs RAM, 256 gig SSD, and 1080 HD screen.  I paid $680.Cons:The fan runs all the time.  You will probably see this noted in other reviews as well.  It's a very quiet fan -- hard to notice in a room with even a little bit of background noise -- but it's obvious in a quiet room.On mine, there is a gap between the screen and the rim of the bottom bezel.  It's not big enough to fit a fingernail into (so, probably less than 1 mm), but big enough for dust to accumulate, and it does not inspire a lot of trust in the build quality.Screen wobbles quite a bit if you bump it.  It's not a loose wobble (yet) but it's a bit disconcerting.  I'd feel a bit better about it if the hinge were stiffer.  I'm not sure how well this will hold up to repeated use.The screen is not very bright, even at full brightness.  My cheap, 4-year-old Dell is blinding in comparison.The \"delete\" key is not in the top, right corner where it belongs.  Instead, the power button is there and the \"delete\" is just to the left of it.  It takes a long-press of the power button to actually turn the computer off, but still.....  This will take some getting used to.Pros:Very thin and light!The keyboard is great.  The chiclet keys don't wobble in their spaces, and there is a slightly tacky feeling to the surface that keeps ones fingers in place.The trackpad works well.  Some have complained that it is not Microsoft-Precision-grade, but it's still very responsive.  It's leaps and bounds better than anything you'll find in any comparably priced laptop.The speakers sound nice.

Under a light load there has been no issue, but if I'm in-between multiple tasks such as video-calling while working on Excel there is a very audible fan noise.-Speaker placement is on the bottom of the laptop. As such, if you're using the laptop on a desk or flat surface there is no issue with sound. However, once removed from a flat surface the sound quality drops quite a bit.-Tilt of laptop screen is not as far back or pronounced as I'm used to.

The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the battery gets nowhere near 10-12 hours with standard websurfing and word processing.  Also, the hinge is a little weird in how far back the lid is able to open.  Not terrible, but odd.  Finally, the keyboard is a little mushy... though the size/placement of the keys is nice.  Overall, I'd say this is a good laptop for the price.  Still, I pray that I never have to talk to ASUS tech support again, as I fear it would be as painful as the first time.ORIGINAL REVIEW: The laptop arrived and could not get past the third screen of the Windows 10 first-boot process without crashing/restarting.  Thankfully, Amazon is taking it back and sending me a new one.  Read on for what actually happened.On first boot, the laptop kept rebooting when clicking \"Next\" and then would just start over (one time I even got a pink background in a set-up screen process instead of the typical blue background).  I called ASUS and got a rep who wasn't very knowledgeable.  She wanted me to go into the Start menu to find the Windows recovery options, which means she wasn't listening... because you can't get to the Start menu if Windows can't even set itself up for first use.  Then she told me how to get into the Windows recovery mode on power-up, by pressing F9 repeatedly.  I did this several times and it didn't work.  I asked her if I should hold down the Fn key while pressing F9, since the laptop Fn keys are shared with other functions.  She said that wasn't necessary.  So, I ignored her on the third try and held down the Fn key... magically it worked.  So far, ASUS support was batting zero.  Once into the recovery mode screens, I tried the full-wipe/reinstall Windows recovery option per ASUS support... and then the laptop said that Windows could not be reinstalled for an unknown reason.  I call that dead on arrival.I'll post an updated review once I get to try it out (assuming this is just one bad apple).","rating":4},{"id":"R2DQ71A8ULWGSC","title":"A quality product at an excellent price.","text":"A well built unit that performs very well, and is very reasonably priced at $700.  The touch pad is sensitive and understands very useful gestures. The screen is pleasing to look at.  Battery life is excellent.  A great travel machine that can be a desktop replacement.  Streams media VERY well.  Speakers sound good.  One criticism is you can't push the display back beyond 110 degrees but this is a relatively minor drawback.  It was this vs the Dell XPS 13.  The Dell is lovely but I don't need the touch screen and a similarly configured unit costs 2.5 times more.  Granted the Dell high end screen is outstanding but I plan to travel with this unit and if it gets lost or stolen I won't cry.  Actually I will cry but not from the cost. :)  Cutting to the chase, a quality product at an excellent price.  B&H Photo has the 500 GB SSD version for $100 more and no tax.  Might want to check that out. Amazon charged me sales tax :(","rating":5},{"id":"R35O1MRDHA6FPT","title":"Perfect for college","text":"I am so glad I decided to purchase this laptop. It is lightweight and easy to carry in my backpack. The battery holds very well, I only charge it once or twice a week and I use it daily. I was deciding between this computer and a mac, but because of the price difference I chose this and I am thankful I did. Overall, it is very similar to a mac besides the price. This laptop is perfect for college, I would recommend it to anyone!","rating":5},{"id":"R1H73K20JGUQSN","title":"Amazing sexy, light and fast laptop under $700","text":"What an awesome everyday laptop for $700. The build and fit and finish is amazing. The small light weight form factor is so sexy and appealing. Runs cool and quiet with very little fan noise. Been using every day and averaging 9-10 hours of battery life keeping screen brightness under 80%.  Pretty fast with Kaby lake processor.  Keyboard and precision trackpad are nice especially with quick finger print scanner.  Keyboard lighting has 3 intensity levels.  Screen is nice and bright with matte finish which I love.  No problems with bluetooth or wifi connectivity. Highly recommend! Going to buy another for my Fiance.","rating":5},{"id":"RCFGZ7L37XWD0","title":"Affordable, quality, and suuuuuper good looking","text":"Don't listen to the haters. This is as nice as it gets for < $700 (I bought mine at $679).Pros:- Keyboard is 99% of a MacBook Pro's- Trackpad is 97% of a MacBook Pro's- Screen is better than a MacBook Air- Build Quality is 95% of a MBP, but arguably better in some ways given the cold wrist wrest of the macbooks which I never liked.- Battery is better than MBP and MBA- Backlit keyboard- Fast CPU- 50-60% of the cost of a MBP or MBACons:- Some plastic in the build, but honestly compared to the MBP I used before this it's a more comfortable wrist wrest than the cold aluminum of a MacBook's- Would have liked option for 16GB RAM, but 8 is still good enough for what I do (I'm a software developer)It's thin, light, and looks amazing. I love carrying it around, and regularly get \"what kind of laptop is that?\". I use an XPS 13 at work, and while I'd argue that's a better laptop, it's hard to justify the $400-$500 extra.If money is no object, get yourself an XPS 13, if you have to have a mac and don't really care that apple isn't evolving that in a way that is cool or valuable - get a macbook. Everyone else should pick this up instead, it's am amazing value.","rating":5},{"id":"R1NACHWWVZB860","title":"Really nice travel laptop.  Had to upgrade Win 10 Home to Pro.","text":"Really nice, light laptop.  I can't do \"real work\" on this, because the 12.5\" screen doesn't have enough real estate for my 50-year-old-eyes.  It is solid and super-light.  Great for people like me that aren't ever really away from work, and even on vacation need an emergency laptop.  The CPU's 2 hyperthreaded cores have plenty of power for everything you'd be doing in this tiny 2-pounder.  Not a gamer laptop.  My only complaints are (1) Windows 10 Home is mostly useless for business (no bitlocker), you have to count on spending $99 to upgrade (2) as with many laptops the touch pad is way too sensitive and thinks I am tapping when I am not, although there are probably adjustments I can make in that regard.","rating":4},{"id":"RGLAS5Y7OQKSP","title":"Zenbook UX330UA-AH54 Review","text":"I've been using this ultrabook for about a day now and I love it. As many reviews have stated it is pretty much a Macbook Air clone with better specs and half the price. The finish has a very premium feel. My experience with this laptop has been very positive so far.The new i5 kaby lake performed very well. It handled twitch streaming together with installing applications in the background without any hiccup. Loading from POST to window was also very quick. I was very impressed as it load just as quick as my custom built desktop with an i7 6700k CPU and Samsung 850 EVO SSD.  I've read a lot of reviews about Asus trackpad not as good compare to XPS and MBA but to be honest if you expect to get precision down to the pixel then you should probably be using a real mouse. The trackpad works fine for me. It goes where I want it to and click when needed to. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on and really happy to have the adjustable LED lit keys.The 1920 x 1080 IPS matte display is also very good. The color production and viewing angle is mazing. A little too saturated for my taste but you can adjust that. The Harman/Kardon downward firing speakers are pretty good especially in a laptop this thin. Asus advertised 12 hours battery life, but from my usage (brightness at 70%, twitch streaming, youtube, netflix, web browsing) the battery lasted about 7-8 hours. However I did have my power plan set at High Performance. I think it might possible to get 12 hours or close if you lower the screen brightness a bit more and use the battery saver power plan.One other thing I was pleasantly surprised with was this laptop came with almost no bloatware at all. Asus only loaded the necessary software for the notebook to function properly (Trackpad gesture, Fn keys, and intel stuff). The only thing I had to uninstall was Microsoft Office 360, but to some this might not be bloatware. They didn't even install any of the Asus utilities software (Splendid View, Sonic Suite, AI Suite, etc.) and leave it up to the user to download and install from their support site.Overall, this was a great purchase for me. The price, quality, and performance this ultrabook offers is just not comparable by any other notebook right now. Asus is one of the top computer components manufacturer and my last Asus laptop served me so well so I am happy that their ultrabook also has that same quality.","rating":5}]
