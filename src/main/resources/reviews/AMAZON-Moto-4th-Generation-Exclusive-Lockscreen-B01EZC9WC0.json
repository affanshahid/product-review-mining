[{"id":"R1ELQJJVGGW7IG","title":"Moto Reclaims the Budget Crown… For Now","text":"Pros+ Excellent Screen+ Great Camera+ Clean Android 6.0 Marshmallow+ Compatible with all major networks+ Great PriceCons- No NFC- No longer waterproof- Bland Design- Competition is Getting Better- Single SpeakerShould You Buy: YesActual Value: $200Contrary to what most reviewers though, I thought Motorola really dropped the ball last year. The Moto G of 2015 had a weak processor, low resolution screen, and an okay, but not great, camera. Perfectly fine in 2014, but not in 2015 and definitely not now. Companies like Alcatel, ASUS, and even small companies like Honor (Huawei) were offering better value for money. But this year, Motorola definitely brought its best. But is it enough to be the best budget phone of the year? In short, yes. The Moto G4 is the best budget phone you should buy today. The question you should ask yourself is, will it be the best value this year?- Design -Motorola has never made the Moto G the stylish one of its lineup. True, with Moto Maker, this can be a very personalized phone. But the overall design has been plain. This year, that trend continues. The new Moto G is plainer than the  with a simple plain back and a simple flat front. Personally I like it. It was built to be a solid, reliable phone and it doesn’t try to be something it’s not. What I don’t like is the lack of more premium material. Blu and Huawei have added metal to the mix, which feels a lot better in the hand compared to the simple plastic build. It’s a great phone, but it could still be better.- Screen -The screen is a 5.5 inch 1080p panel, which is a huge improvement from the old 720p panel on last generation’s phone. I honestly would’ve prefered a 5.2 inch panel, but that’s just a personal preference. This is a very good panel as a whole, but certainly not the best screen available. Text is really sharp and colors are vibrant enough. Whites tend to be slightly on the blue side, but it is not that noticeable and contrast is good, but not excellent. Still, for a phone that cost only $199, it is a great screen and certainly an upgrade if you are coming from last year’s Moto G.- Software -Motorola has kept their reputation of keeping stock Android alive with this phone. Everything is stock and the few additions that Motorola added to the phone are definitely appreciated. Active lock screen is still here and twist gestures are also back from last year. But what makes this different compared to other phones is the Amazon ad experience that allows it to be cheaper than a plain stock version. So, are the Amazon additions something that affects the experience? In short, not really. General usage is just what you’d expect from a typical Android phone and it is hardly noticeable that you have Amazon ads built in. Well, when I say hardly noticeable, I mean in general use. You will always be reminded of the Amazon ads when you unlock, which takes up the entire screen and shrinks to a notification when there are other notifications on the screen. You can easily replace the screen lock with something like the Next Lock Screen app (available on Google Play) and you can get rid of all signs of Amazon ads. Some apps are kind of bloatware, but they are all from Amazon so you can take it or leave it.- Performance -The Moto G4 comes packing an octa-core Snapdragon 617 paired with 2GB of RAM (at least on my version). This is still a decent package and seeing as most of the competition will be using this chip, there isn’t much to complain about. The phone works smoothly and games like Asphalt 8 and Pokemon Go run well. Benchmarks show that the Moto G4 is right in the middle of the pack, ahead of the Sony Xperia M4 and the Nexus 7 (2013). It falls short compared to the 800 series of phones, but the gap is slowly, but surely closing in. For the price, it definitely packs more value for money and keeps the phone running smooth and quick. MicroSD card support is always welcome, especially because it only has 16 GB of storage, which easily fills up. Battery life is too soon to tell, but today at work, it survived the entire day with constant use and it is going towards 5 hours of screen on time. This is looking good and I will update later to confirm whether it stays like that.- Camera -The 13MP back camera and the 5 MP selfie camera are good, but not the best available. The sensor appears to be the same sensor as last year’s Moto G. And in some aspects, it shows. Photos in bright light look vivid and detailed, contrast is good,  and focus is really fast. However, dim the lights and grain starts to find its way onto images that look decent, but good. Low light shots are clearly this camera’s weakness with the sensor not able to grab onto details without creating a muddy image. The 5MP selfie cam works great for Snapchat and Instagram; great detail if a bit mute and flat. But for a $199 phone, it falls right into place within its competitors. Just don’t expect anything mind blowing.- Conclusion -Motorola has , without a doubt, made the best Moto G ever and the best budget phone. The design is good, build quality is excellent, and the camera is decent enough. The screen, while an improvement, is good but not great. Overall,I can’t find anything to fault this phone. But the real problem is the competition. Alcatel’s Idol 4 looks to be improving on everything the Moto G has and the ASUS Zenfone 3 looks really beautiful to hold. The Moto G has stock Android and the (sort of) promise of getting updates faster. But is that really enough to be the best budget phone of 2016? Only time will tell. If you need a phone now or just want a guaranteed good experience on a budget, then go ahead and buy the Moto G. But if you can afford a little more and want the absolute best, I’d recommend waiting to see if the Alcatel or the ASUS can deliver a solid experience.","rating":5},{"id":"R35KK6TZYI664D","title":"Moto G (4th Generation) Hits the Sweet Spot","text":"I've gotten a couple Moto G's in the past for my sons and they liked them so when the Amazon branded Moto G 4th Generation phone became available I jumped on it - the discount is nice and the first few days there was an initial extra $25 discount.I received the phone on the release day - July 12. I am using this on the Ting GSM network, which operates on T-Mobile. I put the Sim in and it simply worked. I didn't even need to change the APN - everything worked flawlessly - cellular service, data and messaging.Pluses:Nice 1080 display - I'm coming from a LG-G3 with a 2K screen and actually like this one better. It doesn't have the resolution of the high priced phone but to my 60 year-old eyes, the contrast is better -I know it's not using as much energy with the lesser amount of pixels.Ergonomics - it's got a nice hand-feel. They've changed the design from the curved back which I thought would be more difficult to handle but it's still a pretty thin phone and I've had no problems handling it with my medium sized hands. The back is a very nice texturized rubber which is quite grippy. The sides however are a bit slippery. I solved this with a cheap thin cover. It's also a bit tall (see the CONS).Sound- a lot better than I expected. Of course, it doesn't have Dolby speakers or even stereo speakers but it's pretty good. I can actually listen to this for a while without switching to my Jambox-  it can get pretty loud without distorting much.Connectivity - Once again, though this is a budget phone, it does beat my previous LG-G3. Bluetooth connects faster, and the phone connects more reliably to my office wireless network. It connected flawlessly to my car.Quick charge. This phone has Qualcomm's Quick Charge 2.0 and a Quick Charge Charger comes with the phone. Very fast charging - I just came home with the phone on 63% and 20 minutes later it's on 89%. What a pleasure.Responsiveness - I haven't noticed any stuttering, or sluggishness. I don't play games so I can't evaluate the phone for that. I love the keyboard response and you can dial in the exact amount of tactile feedback you like.SD card capability - I always like the fact that one can add additional memory and the fact that Android can now configure an SD card as internal memory makes it even more valuable.Camera - the camera is fine. I love when the tech reviewers have to compare a phone's camera to the highest performer. Of course a $600 -$700 phone will have a better camera. But this takes pictures that are just as good as the expensive cameras did a couple of years ago and the reviewers were happy with those.CONS:Lacks the fingerprint sensor - a nice feature but I can live without it.Lacks NFC - so I can't use Android Pay. (though I personally haven't found many places that use it)The phone has a lot of real estate at the top and bottom of the phone, about one-half inch above and one-half inch below the screen. I've had other phones which were not too much bigger than the screen itself.SUMMARYI've decided to move to budget phones from the high spec phones. I pay less initially, skip insurance, and don't sweat if it is lost or stolen. I can replace $150 without too much pain - $600 hurts. This phone, though inexpensive gives me enough quality and performance, that I don't miss my expensive smart phone at all. As I said in the title - this phone hits the sweet spot for me - I really like it.","rating":5},{"id":"R2AH71ORGNCY9Y","title":"Cursed by the Tapdancing Touchscreen","text":" This device replaced five years of Windows Phone ownership, most recently in mid-tier Blu brand devices, so I was pretty excited to return to Android.  I pre-ordered the 32GB model at the sale price going on at that time.  Setting up the device and connecting to my network provider (T-Mobile) were quick and painless.  Within a few minutes, I'd installed some exciting new things and was chasing down pocket monsters with all the rest of the Pokemon Go fanatics.  The most intrusive ad, which is installed on the home screen, can be removed.  The lockscreen ads don't bother me, and I don't find myself missing whatever narcissistic thing I would've stuck there if I had the option.  Sometimes there is a full-screen ad for some Amazon Underground app you'll never want and sometimes there's an ad buried in your quick-view notifications for a possibly weaponized $80 hair dryer.  There have even been times I have had an ad for a new brand of dog food or an interesting-looking book that I've actually clicked (the horror!).The honeymoon phase ended swiftly when about 10 days into ownership, I started experiencing the shuddering, jerking, positively tap-dancing touch screen issues others have detailed.  The phone would get hot and the status bar would start dragging itself down and snapping back up.  On-screen things would start activating when I didn't touch them, and while I'd love to blame a ghost, it seemed pretty clear the screen itself was to blame when the once-vivid display started to fade.  It faded in stripes, like the death throes of an old tube TV that was too-well acquainted with a magnet (don't ask how I know).  Sometimes the colors would return, but they would pretty quickly slide back to \"this isn't even usable and it's just kind of sad\" hues.  Thankfully, Amazon was on top of my replacement request, shipping me a new phone in no time and allowing me to hold on to the old one until I had the replacement all set up.  Transferring to the new phone was a breeze.I had 1.5 months of good times with Phone Number Two, Electric Boogaloo.  Then in mid-September, roughly 2 months from my initial purchase, the touch screen issues came back.  At first, it only happened when the phone was charging, so I thought it might not be as bad as the first phone.  Now, I can't even unlock the device without fighting it for a few minutes first.  The touch screen typically activates in one spot toward the right-middle of the screen, though it can trigger anywhere on the screen and sometimes oscillates between areas, creating an effect like I'm swiping it with my finger.  I've tried to upload a video where I captured some of the battle.  My apologies for the video quality/choppiness.  I am really good at dropping my camera when managing it one-handed, so I had to edit out some tumbles and thuds from the poor camera.  But as you will see, I have to repeatedly hit the power button until I finally get a \"good\" unlock opportunity.  Up until then, the touch screen will continue to activate, bouncing the swipe screen and trying to enter non-passwords.  If I don't monitor it, it will do this all day, leaving me with a near-dead or completely drained phone.I have tried several fixes, including removing the screen protector, trying it without a case, factory resetting it (twice!), rebooting it every time the issue occurs, and letting the battery drain completely before charging.  Nothing has helped.Here are some of the new and interesting experiences I've had with this ornery device:- Try to send your friend a picture of your dog freaking out about being offered yogurt.  Touch screen starts triggering the same spot repeatedly, sends your friend 37 copies of the adjacent image, a blurry shot of your yogurt-smeared dog post freak-out.- Try to take a photo of a boat.  Touch screen decides to trigger an on-screen ad.  Try desperately to close out of the Amazon window.  Touch screen repeatedly tries to add the romance novel it has pulled up to your wishlist.  Die inside a little as the boat drifts out of view before you can get the phone to cooperate.- Mom calls.  Touch screen decides to hang up on her mid-conversation.  Touch screen then deigns to not function for nearly five minutes, giving your mom plenty of time to stew in her indignant \"you hung up on me\" furor.- A Charmander appears in Pokemon Go.  Excitedly tap it and prepare to capture.  Touch screen feels you have too many Pokeballs, repeatedly spills them out on the ground until you are down to two.  Probably ashamed at this display, the Charmander runs away after your first actual attempt at capture.- Approach a Pokestop in Pokemon Go.  Try to hit the Pokestop, touch screen decides to trigger an encounter with the wild Pidgey across the street instead, then resumes spilling out your Great Balls on the ground in front of the Pidgey's judging gaze.- Try to show a coworker something a mutual friend sent via Facebook.  Touch screen triggers the Reply option on some friend-of-a-friend's pro-Trump manifesto, then types out \"oooopppoooooooooo.\"  Coworker can't see what you were trying to show over the Trump photo and \"oooopppoooooooooo\" that won't go away because the touch screen keeps activating the field.- Try to queue up driving directions.  Touch screen insistently taps on one spot, until the maps app asks if you want to go to that Roy Rogers up the road that it thinks you're frantically tapping on.  Touch screen acknowledges this on its own.  Suddenly get diverted to a Roy Rogers instead of the intended car dealership.  (This one wasn't a complete tragedy.  I did like the weird burger with ham on it.)I am unsure of what I will do next.  I've tried to \"tough it out\" in hopes for a recall, given how many people have the issue (if you look at the forums, you'll find quite a bit of grumbling about this issue).  However, I imagine I will need to deal with Motorola customer service and it will have to go in for a warranty repair, and I will be a Phoneless Wonder for however long it takes.  Or I'll need to find free alternatives to breakfast/lunch/dinner long enough to save up for one of those devices that are far costlier but less likely to act possessed.If anything changes, for better or for worse (and certainly for richer or for -more likely- poorer), I will update this review.  I hope, in the meantime, it saves someone else a headache.","rating":1},{"id":"RE7E06MB30K0B","title":"Excellent piece of kit","text":"This phone, overall, is a good product when you factor in the price, specs, and use-case.  I've owned many phones (a hobby that the wife disagrees with!).  This phone will work for 95% of people and is excellent overall.We'll start with the actual device:The specs are clearly listed and all that jazz, so I won’t go over that.  The phone feels well in the hand and I’m coming from the rather large Nexus 6.  It’s a thin phone and while it is almost as tall many phones, it feels a lot less wide.  I have big hands and thought I’d want the biggest phone.  I have to say, phones like this Moto G4, are about the sweet spot for me.The volume buttons are easy and I rarely push those as I set my phone to completely silent 98% of the time and once I’ve adjusted my calling volumes and such, I don’t fuss with them.  It’s the power button that’s a bit more difficult and a sore point on otherwise great hardware.  It is textured compared to the volume rocker, but even with that it’s almost undisguisable from it.  I have a hard time pushing it with my right hand using my thumb, but left handed and using my index finger is much easier.  I luckily hold my phone leftie mostly, so not a problem, but the button doesn’t push as easily as it should and it requires an odd angle.  This is probably the only physical detriment to the phone – otherwise it’s great in the hand.And yes, this base model Moto G4 comes with the turbo-charger.  There was a lot of misinformation early on if that was included - it is.Android OS:This runs a custom version of Android, but it's pretty close to stock.  Also, there aren't really any phones that run stock Android as Google's own line of phones runs many proprietary apps and code that isn't 'stock'. The basic apps are included and you get ALL of Amazon's related apps and services - even some that are essentially duplicates.  You can disable what you don't want through apps settings.  I did keep many Amazon apps and they are just the Play store ones and function quite well.  I disabled a few of the other stock apps such as Google's music, videos, etc.  I use other things for this and it saves memory on the phone and space in the app drawer.The overall OS is snappy, it does lag a bit if you open larger/intensive apps or you are going through things quickly.  If you keep your open apps to a reasonable amount (not 30 apps and 17 Chrome tabs) the phone runs just as well as my old Nexus 6 or other recent phones.  It plays games fine, again there might be a jitter or two here, but I've had the best of phones do that.The other included software stuff that is nice is an FM radio that Moto usually adds.  Data may be unavailable or you may be on a limited plan and if you want music, this can be a life saver.  I'd had an original Moto G back in the day and was on a tight budget - free music came in handy!  The ambient screen feature is cool too.  If you pull the phone up to you or out of your pocket, a mostly blacked screen shows and you can see the unlock area and any notifications you may have.  It also shows the battery indicator with a % too!The dreaded lock screen apps.  I'm a bit torn on this as it doesn't work exactly like my Fire HD 7 tablet.  That always has a nice add up, but you can swipe away as you open the device and I've never accidentally opened an ad.  I haven't opened an ad on this phone yet either unless I meant to, but at times when you unlock the phone, it brings up the ad that you have to unlock again.  This seemed to happen every few times I'd open the phone.  It's jarring when you pull the phone up and the ambient screen is on and you unlock and BAM AD!  I get it was why the phone was heavily discounted, but a lot of extra swiping is not fun.  As a note - as of now, it seems Amazon worked around putting another lock screen app on to bypass theirs.  You can do this, but their ads will still pop up after you unlock with the new lock screen.  Additionally, and this is a major drawback to certain people, they've literally disabled the ability to bypass the lock screen completely.  On any other Android device, you can change how you unlock the phone - swipe to unlock, PIN, fingerprint (if available), or you can choose none.  If you don't pick any, when you hit your power button you go right to your home screen.  Amazon has, in a rather crude way, disabled this.  When I went in to try to turn any screen off, it just backs you out.  Very annoying.  It also says amz or the like in many areas pertaining to the software so they have put a lot of their own code into the phone.  Updates for the device will be a TBA affair I guess - again I'll write back if more is discovered.My phone did update already, a small 10mb file to 'improve calling'. I didn't have issues before and the update came a day after getting the phone.  So, someone is pushing updates.Screen:The screen is pretty good and overall vibrant and sharp for the size.  It's not a 1440p screen and it isn't the largest screen out there, but that's partially why I got it - I was tired of the phablet size and I'm a larger guy with big hands even.  For the size and resolution, it's a very good combo though and my eyes don't mind looking at it.  I've used all the special LCD screens and the AMOLED ones - I was tired of the eye searing colors on the AMOLED and the hard to read in sunlight and the burn-in issues.  This screen, in the bright Phoenix AZ sun is very readable.  Colors are pretty true, after I set the screen on the normal setting in the menus.  It has a vibrant feature that, ironically, made the screen and colors look washed out.Another HUGE plus for this screen is the fact I noticed no bleed through or bright spots.  I put a black screen on in my very dark house and the brightness was uniform and I didn't see any light bleed.  This is very impressive for a phone in this category.  I've had flagship phones with these issues to the point it was annoying.  I'll report back over time if this changes.Also, the touch screen is sensitive, but not as sensitive as some phones.  This can be good and bad.  I'm always torn on what I want, but less sensitive means I'm not accidentally dialing the mother-in-law after I end another conversation, saving me time!  Again, the touch sensitivity is uniform across the screen.  Also, the screen is very resilient, no bending or spots that pop up near the edge.Camera(s):I'm adding this as an edit as I forgot about it!  The camera is middle of the road, but takes very quick pictures.  Moto has added more over the stock camera app such as sliding the zoom circle to adjust white exposure.  They also added things like shake to change camera.  The rear camera is quick as I said and takes adequate pictures.  They are clear, HDR mode obviously helps with contrast and making things in the picture 'pop'.The front camera is actually very good, especially given the mid-level specs of the phone.  It's crystal clear and better than any other front camera I've had on a phone.  It would more than suffice for the night out selfie or video chat.Battery:The battery life so far has been impressive.  I got the phone out of the box charged pretty full (over 80%).  I did the full set up, played some games, logged into my apps again.  I'd say I was at about 60% after all that.  I know that's not the most accurate without screen on time or such, but Android's set up and downloading a few dozen apps and updates over wifi is battery intense.  As another review has already said though, this puppy heats up quickly.  Charging it I noticed it got warm pretty fast and when it was downloading over wifi it got warm too.  I've noticed it getting warm playing games, but this could be the battery and/or the CPU causing it - I'm guessing both.  I will update if I notice battery life becomes noticeably worse before its time.Connectivity/data/calling:This phone can work on all 4 major networks and I'm using a GSM carrier.  I won't review my carrier, as you can bring this phone to pretty much any prepaid or postpaid option out there.  LTE is strong on this phone and data speeds are just as fast as my other phones I tested against in my house.  VoLTE works well on this phone and is crisp as ever.  The 3G (UMTS/HSPA) on this phone works well too and calling is again pretty clear.  Speeds are also very fast.  There is no carrier aggregation yet where I live, so I can't tell you how that works, but I imagine speeds are even better.More specifics on the few calls I've made - nobody has complained about static or background noises.  I hear them very well and the volume is acceptable to even a bit loud.  No dropped calls yet and no data issues either.  The phone paired instantly in my newer model car (car has built in Bluetooth).  Sounds crystal clear over the Bluetooth and also streaming music played well.  The speaker is also pretty loud and while it's only on one part of the phone (my Nexus 6 had stereo), it sounds just fine for a small device.  It's not mind-blasting like front row to the Rolling Stones, but it's acceptable for calls and such.Overall and conclusion:Yes, this is a great phone at the price.  Yes, you have to deal with Amazon ads but that was clearly a part of the deal.  The phone is equal to a $600+ flagship in 95% of the ways and really the phone would work for 95% of people as I mentioned.  It does show it a budget phone with the heat issues on the battery and/or CPU, but my old Nexus 6 did the same thing. It feels good in the hand and looks like any other slab style phone these days so it won't be turning heads, but does a phone need to?  If you are in the market to upgrade from a couple year old phone or looking to replace a recent broken one, this is a great deal.  If you have a newer flagship phone, keep it as it's equal or better than this most likely - but keep the Moto G line in mind when you want to upgrade in a couple years.So, for the price that Amazon offers this with special ads and the overall package the Moto G4 offers, I’d say it’s a definite buy if you you’re in the market as I said above.  It would make an excellent phone for a young teen, college grad, dad, wife, friend, or really anyone.  It would also make a great back up phone for those times where you may want to use a ‘beater phone’ – ie camping, vacation, etc.Edit on 7/19/2016:A few more things - I've added a couple pictures.  These are taken at night, I'll get some daylight pictures soon, but I figured indoor and low light pictures are more telling on how good a camera is.  This one does surprisingly well still - it's well within or above this category of phone. The picture of the stuff on the table is in a well lit room with the settings all on auto - I did tap to focus as the only adjustment and upped the white a little to match the room brightness.  The second picture of the TV is a very dark room with HDR on (flash cannot be on too) - it's not the best, but at least it looks 'OK' for a dark picture.  The last picture of the bench/door were in a pretty dim hallway with the flash on (no HDR, again can't both be on).The other, more egregious update is I had to get the phone exchanged already from Amazon.  The issue I listed above about the power button was big - it almost wouldn't push it and I could only get it to register a push if I was very forceful and pushed on the top part.  The replacement button is noticeably better and has much better travel and can be pushed easier - so there are some QC issues on the hardware here.  Given it was a defect out of the box, I was able to get an exchange, but only time will tell about it lasting.Edit 10/27/2016:I used the phone on and off for quite a while - but I finally gave it to my mother.  She broke her ancient Galaxy S3 (time to go anyway).  We popped her SIM from the S3 into this, and off it went.  Calls, LTE, data, all work very well on VZW too (I was previously using it on T-Mobile).  She loves it and says it's great for her.  No issues with the power button either, so hopefully the original one I received was a fluke.","rating":4},{"id":"RW443BYZNHOJV","title":"Nice for iPhone switcher","text":"We got this phone for me wife. She really likes it coming off an iPhone 5. Since I'm \"tech support\" for her and did the setup I do have some first-hand experience. We mainly switched to get off of our high-cost Verizon Wireless plan in favor of a much lower cost alternative. We settled on Republic Wireless for now. My wife likes the size of the screen, it's clarity (although not as good as my iPhone 6 Plus in my opinion) and the ease of use. There were a few challenges to overcome coming from the iPhone and I found totally acceptable solutions for them.One challenge was photos. All he photos were on her iPhone and in iCloud. I installed the Google Photos app on her iPhone to upload all her photos to her Google account. The Photos app installed on on Moto G then downloaded all her photos onto that phone. Also configured the new phone to automatically backup photos which was important because my wife also has an iPad. The Google Photos app on the iPad is also installed on the iPad so that  now the photos are accessible on all devices just like they were with Apple Photos and iCloud. She now just uses Google Photos instead of Apple Photos.The other challenge was iTunes music. But that proved to be straight forward with \"Double Twist\" and their free app on the Mac and their $5 wireless-connection app on the phone. Now with just an extra step or two my wife can easily keep her iTunes synced with the Moto G. To be honest. Double Twist took a bit of tinkering to get going, mostly due to some issues in her iTunes library. But now it's working very well. Make a change in iTunes, go to Double Twist and press sync and it's done.Double Twist is also nice on the phone because it's much more iTunes like than the Apple Music which I think is a bloated, confusing mess. iTunes isn't much better in my opinion but at least now the interfaces are consistent.Other than this one renegade Android phone we are an all Apple house and there is no access to Apple TV for example from the phone. But that's not an issue for us because we have two other iPads and my iPhone and two Macs if we need to share from one of those Apple devices to ATV (which is rare).All in all, considering we took her monthly phone cost from about $60 to about $23 a month and she hasn't given up any significant functionality it's a good choice for us based on our level of data usage. I'll be following in her footsteps in a few weeks as soon as my VW contract is up and may go with Ting which as another reasonable cost provider.","rating":5},{"id":"R32E348YLTCVRQ","title":"Why did I do this to myself again?!?!","text":" I just came from a horrible run with the G4 Play, I went through 4 of them, all with defective GPS. After less than 2 months I gave up on replacing it over and over and got my money back.So what did I do? I bought the regular Moto G4, which has functional GPS. Having GPS that actually works was nice.After a couple days the random waking started. Usually while it was charging, but not always. Face up or face down. The phone would just wake itself up for no apparent reason. There would be no notifications, no movement near it, it just decided that it wanted to be on. This wouldn't have been so bad, but it would never go back to sleep on its own either, even after many hours. The 3rd time I caught it doing this it had happened overnight while sitting unplugged on a table and was down to 3% battery.On the 12th day (today) the ghost touches started. I was walking along and it started spamming the home button. I have \"show touches\" enabled (a habit I formed after dealing with the ghost touch issue of the OnePlus One), so it was very obvious what was happening. I had my other phone on me and took a video of it. It stopped after I put it to sleep and unlocked it again, but it started to do it again 10-15 minutes later.A quick Google search when I got home and this issue is likely bigger/more common than the defective GPS on the Play. Nope, nope, nope. I'm not even going to try a replacement this time, or 3, or even waste my time again with Moto support (zero response from them on any of the defective G4 Plays), and just return it to Amazon for refund.I really wanted the G4 play to workout. It is the only phone I had found that has a very completely set of supported LTE bands across the main 3 carriers and wasn't $700+. Unfortunately it seems that each edition of the G4 series has their own major defect(s).I don't know what happened to Moto. My Moto X Pure was pretty good (sans overheating and weak battery life issues). I think I'm done with Moto phones for good now, they clearly can't seem to make a device that doesn't have massive issues with the basic functionality.TL;DR: In a sample size of 5 phones in 2 months, the G4 and G4 Play (and likely the Plus) series has a 100% defect rate.","rating":1},{"id":"R39O0BYWQUJ8OU","title":"Can't recommend this phone at all","text":"This phone has some serious issues with the \"ghost touch\" while charging..( you can search YouTube to view it ) .

Even quickly unplugging if it  doesn't ensure it will \"settle down\" in time to answer the call... Can't recommend this phone at all..Not sure what my options are at this point as the phone is six weeks old.. Amazon was good enough to mail me a new charger free when the one included didn't work, but now this?  Find something better.. We have a 3rd generation in this phone which works flawlessly, and I'm not sure if it's the new manufacturer or what, but this is very disappointing..  UPDATE...  Have found that if I use the charger from my moto g 3rd generation everything works fine. After one month wit the old charger have yet to the phantom / ghost touch issue return.

Many reviewers felt it to be an outstanding mid-range device, but one or two did mention overheating issues due to the phone's Snapdragon 617 chipset. Swayed by the \"best budget phone ever made\" reviews and the amazing(!) deal on Amazon, I decided to take a chance.I received the phone on its release day, July 12. My first thought upon opening the box was, \"It's beautiful!\" I loved the size, display, expandable memory, etc. But almost right away, the phone got VERY hot. Researching a little more, I read that smartphones may get hot during the initial set up because of all the downloading and what not, so I thought I'd keep tabs on the issue over the next few days.I noticed that the phone kept getting hot with just a few minutes of doing anything, even just browsing the internet, so yesterday, I decided to install an app that would help detect overheating. This morning, after about 10 minutes of playing Soda Crush, the phone registered 107.1 degrees Fahrenheit. After letting the phone cool down for half-an-hour, I used the phone to read some news stories online. The phone then registered 105.2 degrees. The ambient temperature was 78 degrees.The \"solution\" posted on the Moto/Lenovo forums is hardly helpful [...], as I'm not in the middle of heatwave. I'm not using the phone with a case, and none of the other situations apply.Aside from the heat issue, the phone is fine. The overheating hasn't caused any performance problems as far as I can tell. I don't know if I got a dud. A search of the Amazon reviews for \"heat\" or \"hot\" came back with only 8-10 results. I'm debating whether or not I should return or exchange the Moto g. I'm torn because I like the phone otherwise and would rather not pay more than double or triple for a different phone. :(","rating":3},{"id":"R23W6AH8K4OARK","title":"JUNK - BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE","text":"I don't write a lot of reviews but when a product is this bad and customer service is this bad I feel I owe it to everyone.To start I only had the phone a few months when Motorola decided to do an update on the software. After the update my phone randomly turned itself off during phone calls or while in my pocket. I contacted Motorola they had me send the phone in to be repaired. And I thought okay now this could be just a bad phone. After 10 days I receive my replacement phone. This phone was in a boot screen mode and will do nothing. I contacted Motorola and they said they would send me a new return label and that I would have to wait another 10 days to get another phone back. Two days later I still hadn't received a return label. I called them again and after 45 minutes on hold I was told they would send me a return label.I order a different manufactures phone.P.SI didnt even notice the ads on the phone","rating":1},{"id":"R96LOBZDY62SP","title":"Buggy phone!!","text":"I thought this phone was great at first then the problems began.

This is totally unacceptable. Now i have to go out and buy another phone out of my pocket because this one will not work normally.

I have wasted countless hours on this phone just trying to get it to work as it should.  I would never do the Prime Exclusive discount again as I  suspect that may be the origin of the glitch.I just spent more time talking to Amazon and got them to remove the Prime ads from the phone.  They usually charge $50 for that but did it for free because of all the problems I've had.  If that does fix the glitches I will update my review.

It offers rock-solid Bluetooth, good apps, and is an excellent telephone as well.  The advertising annoys me quite a bit although one does get used to that in time. The ubiquitous ads are why I rated it only 4 stars. There are so many ads popping up everywhere these days, not just on smartphones, that it's hard to tell which are the Amazon directed ads or which are Android or Google ads. Next time I'll pay the extra bucks to get a cleaner interface.The other reason I wrote this review is to explain an issue I had and how I resolved it. My wifi connection began experiencing problems after the last big s/w upgrade a month or two ago (Android Marshmallow 6.0.1) the phone would experience problems seeing the Internet signal from my wifi router located only inches away. The wifi was still connected to the G4 and other phones and laptops had no problem, but the G4 was offline. At this time it would report, \"connected, no Internet\". Rebooting seemed to help occasionally as did powering off and on but neither solution worked reliably. After a time, the Internet would magically reappear.I tried many fixes but what finally worked was to clear the reminder banners that are always present on the opening screen. These banners consist of ads, nags from email or other apps wanting your attention, system notices and similar.  If you fiddle with the scrolling of that message cluster several little rectangles will appear at its  bottom right. Touching these bars instantly clears the ads. I discovered this quite by accident and ever since then I've been clearing those reminders after opening the phone. I've never again lost the Internet. Once it connects to a router, it stays connected.Hopefully, this will help others who might be experiencing \"wifi\" problems with their G4","rating":4},{"id":"R2S0EXW8KJPJQL","title":"Great phone for the price","text":"Great phone for the price.

I was not willing to drop $750 per phone for the whole family.  Luckily these were released just before we made the switch.  I did some research and decided that these would work.  They work GREAT.  The whole family loves them.  We are not hung up on having the latest and greatest or with keeping up with the Jones'.  My previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy S4 that I lived with for several years. This phone is much better and there is nothing that I miss from my old phone.PROS:  Great battery life  16MP camera  Works with almost any US Carrier (Ours are on Verizon Wireless)  No Carrier Bloatware.  I install what I want.  You can format the SD as \"Internal Storage\" which moves apps, pictures, videos, cached data, and other items to it via the OS. I used to  do this manually before.CONS:  Since they are new (and I assume not as mainstream) accessories are limited (no UAG case...)

It charges super fast though so I don't worry about a dead phone. It does get warm when it charges. It has a really good great camera too!As far as LOCK SCREEN ADS, I don't care what is on my lock screen so they don't bother me. I have a number pin to lock my phone and I disabled the Amazon app. I found out that if I click the ad and unlock the phone, the ad does not open up because it defaults to opening the ad in the Amazon app. This prevents the ads from being opened at all, intentionally or unintentionally. I don't want to open the ads so this discovery was helpful. Also when you have notifications on the lock screen the ads appear as a small notification(only on lock screen) instead of taking up the whole screen.I got he phone for $125 and I would have paid more because I love the phone!!","rating":5},{"id":"R2W1VH6C1IMSN8","title":"Wonderful Phone and a Great Carrier","text":"With over 1400 reviews there's little I can add except for the carrier I chose.

I bought a Sim card on Amazon which was on sale at the time for $1, inserted it along with a 32GB SanDisc Ultra SD card in my phone, and set about activating it on Tracfone's website. Their Smart Phone Bring Your Own Phone rate was $125 a year and when I chose that plan a window came up asking if I'd like another year for $50 more. I said yes and got two years of service for $175 or $7.29 a month.I make few phone calls and use my wifi most of the time so will need little data, but will still no doubt need to buy some additional data over the two years of service. Adding data costs $10 per GB.I've had the phone for 6 weeks now and am very pleased with both the phone and the carrier.

I came from a galaxy s4 to shoot comparison. There are a few things that are just different from a company specific phone vs an unlocked one so a little bit of a learning curve there. But it gives you the freedom to pick what apps YOU want rather than what is crammed into a phone from the store. This phone checked every box for me as far as features. Expandable memory, good operating system, excellent screen and resolution. The only thing I regret is not getting the plus with 4gb of RAM. If I had to do it over that's what I would have done. Very happy with my purchase.The only thing that I have noticed that's been an issue isn't directly related to the phone itself. Since the phone is not a top tier level ( but it should be) the options for cases are limited. I've searched can only seen to come up with cheaper options. I had my s4 in an OtterBox defender the whole time. Sadly, that wasn't an option for this phone.

My wife is very happy with it. I am about to replace my phone and am highly considering getting the exact phone for myself. I think there may have been some confusion in my original post below. The preinstalled apps are not a big issue as there is plenty of space in the phone. And as some replies pointed out they can easily be disabled. I just wanted to state that in the original review so others like myself would know what to expect.Bought this phone for my wife to replace her old Samsung. We got tired of paying $600+ every 2 years for a phone so we started looking at unlocked phones. I myself have a Blu phone which I am happy with but does have some quirks that require some patience that sometimes my wife does not with technology. Figured a well known brand with the support a Amazon wouldn't have these issues. She's really only had the phone for 2 days but she really enjoys it. Have T-mobile, activating the phone was as simple as switching the Sim Chip. She received her first text while we were still setting the phone up, hadn't even transferred the contacts yet.  This is easily a $200+ phone and with the Amazon Prime discount definitely puts it near the top for its price point.The one downside is this is not a truly unlocked phone. There are pre-installed apps that you can disable but cannot remove, this isn't the case with my Blu phone, I have full control.

As other reviewers mentioned, I read the review in The Verge where the author had a meltdown over lagging keystrokes and jittery animation and have to say they must have gotten a lemon because my phone runs as smooth as glass.  I was curious how invasive the lockscreen ads would be as well and find I'm not bothered by them at all.  Because I have notifications on the lockscreen turned on, I only ever see one of the little strip ads at the bottom of my notifications.  It is completely insignificant.  In addition, the Amazon apps pre-installed on the phone aren't bloatware to me since I use all but one of them on a regular basis.

Since I went with the Amazon Prime edition I understood that it will have ads, but they aren't invasive like the Metro Pcs ads.

It also has issues connecting to bluetooth, it doesn't detect our speaker (the rest of our devices have no problem). In order for it to detect the speaker and reconnect to it we have to reset the network settings. This is really disappointing as we love using our phones with bluetooth speakers and my boyfriend is a truck driver and needs to be able to connect to a bluetooth headset to talk to his dispatcher. Probably going to have to return the phone for something else if we can't get these issues worked out. It seems like a really great phone other than these issues.","rating":3},{"id":"R3BHO7MMZTRX4C","title":"Great phone for the price!","text":"Great phone for the price! Bought it for my son instead of a tablet, he's using wifi only, but we'll eventually hook him up with cell service once he's driving. He uses a free internet voice/text service, and the microphone/speaker work fine with that, no quality issues. Good size, good screen, fast enough to run most all apps.

The phone is actually quite good.  The problem I had was in my Tmobile account.  A simple change in the account by the Customer service Rep fix the problem.Actually, this seems like a really nice phone but I cannot get it to work on Tmobile's network.  Once I received the phone it was set up quickly and worked well in my house when connected to WiFi.  Once I was out of WiFi range LTE would drop off.I worked with Tmo's techs to insure I had the correct settings--to no avail.  Then I called Motorola.  Motorola said to reset the phone.  I did that.  Phone did not work.  Did it again....Phone did not work.So I ordered a replacement from Amazon.  It arrived today.  Same thing.

Without the Amazon software I would like this phone generally but Amazon has made it a real hassle to use the phone.  It is advertised as having adverts on the swipe screen.  While this is true they don't tell you that they have made it very difficult to only swipe the screen once.  You have to swipe the screen multiple times before it will change to the login screen.  Once your in the phone everything works fine so the insensitivity to moving past the advertisement is PROGRAMMED in!  Once your in your phone there are other advertisements, not just the swipe screen, and Amazon has loaded the phone with bloatware, some of which cannot be removed.  Pay the extra $50 for the ad free version because the ads cannot be removed.

It will be impossible for a random person to guess that this phone costs $199. The brightness is pretty good and I do not see much need to put it at maximum screen brightness.Battery lasts me all day easily with frequent Youtube watching, music listening, mixed with google maps using gps, and turning on LTE on when I go out. Yesterday my usage was from 8 am to midnight with 6 hours of  screen time (30% brightness which is more than adequate indoors) and it had about 15% left. Put it on the turbo charger provided in the box and about an hour later the battery reached 97%.The Processor is fast and there is no lag that I noticed.The front speaker is better than my huawei g8 which costs $300. The moto g4 surprised me with its volume strength as I was expecting a quiet low quality budget speaker.Camera takes pictures and videos as expected. Video quality is good, camera focus speed is okay and has good settings and is sufficient for the price. If I send my family pictures of my apartment with the back camera they will think its from any phone, it just doesn't do well with small details and blurs them in low light(shows in pictures of carpet, napkin roll and grass). Overall it gives pleasant pictures as long as your not posting your pics for professional photography purposes.What I don't like is the power button on the side, since I am used to opening the screen through other means (double tap screen or finger print), To compensate Moto has the unlock circle show on  screen  whenever the phone is moved from a standstill or whenever the phone is tilted after 5 seconds of laying still  or whenever the phone is removed from your pocket.Build quality is durable and will take some water drops and spills. The back panel gets a B for texture and plastic feeling but the metal ring surrounding the phone feels premium  and feels like a moto phone.Update:11-10-2016I returned the phone as I needed a Gps to guide me during walks and I got tired of getting lost.

This is totally unacceptable. Now i have to go out and buy another phone out of my pocket because this one will not work normally.

My previous Moto G3 had been my favorite phone ever. However after about 1-2 months of use I started getting the \"ghost touch\" issue a lot of these reviews are also mentioning: the phone begins to overheat, batteries start lasting less and less, and the screen starts to act by itself, as if being touched by someone who isn't there. These start happening more and more often, very gradually. Now, 4 months after purchase, I get the ghost touch more often than not, which makes the phone almost unusable.Here are SOME examples of what the ghost touch has decided to do on my phone:- From whatsapp chats, added people into my phone's contacts list under the wrong names, so that I have to be permanently be asking people who they are.- Bought random apps from the google play store. Took me a while to notice this as they never actually downloaded. Luckily they were all free apps, but these are all very random things that I do not want.- Called a friend from high school (I'm 25) at midnight on a Tuesday, and then refused to let me hang up until he actually picked up and I had to explain.- Called several other people at random, from family members to acquaintances.- Started playing youtube videos at full volume while I'm at work.- Prevented me from taking pictures, as ghost touch would permanently switch the focus, making them blurry.- Prevented me from using google maps correctly,  as it keeps zooming in/out and/or changing the destinations.- Attempted to send random pictures from my phone to random group chats -> luckily I've been able to prevent these by locking the screen in time.I contacted my local Motorola support and they said that it's a manufacturing issue that has come up in a lot of these phones, which came out wrong from the factory. There's a chance you may not get one of the malfunctioning ones, but there's also a chance that you will as this is such a persistent issue.","rating":1},{"id":"R2O85HK7MBYFLO","title":"Run away... Run fast...","text":"OK, first off this review is about the phone, and the support for it.  I will first say: buyer beware...  Amazon does not support this device, Motorola does...  And that is about the worst possible thing.  They will try to charge you to replace an in warranty phone with no damage. Or wait up to a month for their slow process to return your old phone with just a new battery and all the while try to \"solve\" you problems with the everyday reset your phone, do a hard reboot, etc and do everything in their power to avoid a warranty repair...OK on to my experience...  I bought this phone as a cheap stop gap device as my old phone was recalled and I didn't want to buy an expensive last gen device with all the new ones coming out in the spring.  I purchased this in November, by December it was overheating (Too hot to even hold) lagging and couldn't be off battery for more than an hour without losing 100% of the battery and frying your hand.  I contacted Motorola and they wanted to either charge $25 bucks to send me a new phone with a $499 \"hold fee\" or I could send them the phone, they \"fix\" it then return it.  So since I only paid about $150 I opted for the latter.  This was December 4th...  I got my device back on January 11th and you could tell it had only had the battery replaced, I know this as all the issues still exist and the plastic where it had overheated was still melted.  It still lags, it now lasts 4 hours off cord now, but still gets super hot...As to the amazon ads, they were nothing and actually kind of helpful at times as it knew what I was searching on Amazon and targeted the ads...  But good luck if you ever need service, even warranty service as you will not be pleased...I cannot in good conscience recommend this phone.  If Amazon handled warranty work it would be awesome, but Motorola's warranty service stinks...  I think I'd rather have risked my exploding phone for an extra 4 months than dealt with this fiasco.  This put me off all Motorola products...  I'd give it negative stars if I could...","rating":1},{"id":"R2QITQ5AB8HY1R","title":"Very pleased with standard version","text":"Amazon version is no longer truly unlocked.Motorola will not give the bootloader unlock code for the Amazon version of the phone any longer so the phone cannot be rooted etc.For me that was final deal breaker and the phone went back the first day, I need my phones rooted for apps I run.The standard version I had zero problems getting the code.Also the ads are annoying anyone saying they are not is kidding themselves to the tune of the fifty bucks saved, in the long run I bet they will regret.They may not be overly intrusive but they are constantly running and some cannot be shut off as well, also they will use your data when connected may not be all that much but for some it could be another problem.The phone has a nice data management feature you can see that for your self.The phone is fast powerful and runs cool, no overheating as one or two described.Went with the 16gb version and a 128gb fast micro sd card formatted in phone so now it appears to have over a solid 110gb storage, no more juggling around apps for space marshmallow does it automatically storing app data on the add in card.The catch with that is can only be used in the phone from that point unless you format it back to a standard card, in other words if you took the card out and put it in a reader it would not show anything marshmallow formats and encrypts it for in phone use only.Would be nice to have two sd slots but hey can't have it all for that price.There are not a lot of apps that come built in mostly standard Google stuff, even the Moto file explorer had to enable that through the Google play, I find ES File explorer the best anyway but the Moto one has it's good points.For music and video VLC of course plays everything you can throw at it and is very clean and easy to navigate and make play lists etc.Best part is like it's PC counterpart has zero ads what so ever or any other kind of nags.No NFC, that's kind of a bummer if it had that it would truly be an amazing valueThe Camera I cannot really say much about except for what it is works very well, I have a high end DSLR and lenses so everything less than that looks like crap either way. Yes I am a snob when it comes to that.Very happy with the GPS accuracy and sensitivity locks on just about everywhere, combined with Sygic gps app it works fantastic.For 200 bucks you really can't go wrong with this phone, looks great as well.Oh for me it felt a bit thin some like that but I got a nice case with belt clip and gave it the bulk that feels good in my hands.","rating":5},{"id":"R2UG7SDZSYFEYX","title":"Overheats VERY Quickly","text":"So I did a lot of research before pre-ordering the Moto G 4th Generation. Many reviewers felt it to be an outstanding mid-range device, but one or two did mention overheating issues due to the phone's Snapdragon 617 chipset. Swayed by the \"best budget phone ever made\" reviews and the amazing(!) deal on Amazon, I decided to take a chance.I received the phone on its release day, July 12. My first thought upon opening the box was, \"It's beautiful!\" I loved the size, display, expandable memory, etc. But almost right away, the phone got VERY hot. Researching a little more, I read that smartphones may get hot during the initial set up because of all the downloading and what not, so I thought I'd keep tabs on the issue over the next few days.I noticed that the phone kept getting hot with just a few minutes of doing anything, even just browsing the internet, so yesterday, I decided to install an app that would help detect overheating. This morning, after about 10 minutes of playing Soda Crush, the phone registered 107.1 degrees Fahrenheit. After letting the phone cool down for half-an-hour, I used the phone to read some news stories online. The phone then registered 105.2 degrees. The ambient temperature was 78 degrees.The \"solution\" posted on the Moto/Lenovo forums is hardly helpful [...], as I'm not in the middle of heatwave. I'm not using the phone with a case, and none of the other situations apply.Aside from the heat issue, the phone is fine. The overheating hasn't caused any performance problems as far as I can tell. I don't know if I got a dud. A search of the Amazon reviews for \"heat\" or \"hot\" came back with only 8-10 results. I'm debating whether or not I should return or exchange the Moto g. I'm torn because I like the phone otherwise and would rather not pay more than double or triple for a different phone. :(","rating":3},{"id":"R34R00EZ0Q993J","title":"Best smartphone I've ever owned!","text":"The Moto G4 is the best smartphone I've found for the price. It has double the internal storage of the largest smartphone I've owned before it so I can run all the apps I like without having to shuffle them in and out. The phone has a focusing camera that works as advertised and gives me better pictures than I've experienced with any of my previous phones. Call quality (yes, I do make voice calls with my smartphone) are clear and of good quality. The phone is big--it's the biggest one I've owned--but that means that viewing web pages and reading my Kindle app are that much easier (not to mention watching videos.)This is the Amazon Prime version but the ads are unobtrusive and I see no reason to disable them. In fact, most of the time I can bypass the lock screen with the ads and go directly to the log in screen! I also like the motion activated features. Twist your wrist twice while holding the phone and the camera comes on--even from a lock screen. Do it again and the phone switches from the rear camera to the front camera and back again. Do a chopping motion twice while holding the phone and the flashlight function comes on--a second double chop turns it off. There are other motions I haven't learned yet but they are all listed in the owner's manual.Ah, the owner's manual--there's the rub. The phone comes with no documentation at all, aside from the legal disclaimers and a four-step pictographic \"Getting Started\" located on the cardboard that separates the phone from the accessories. You can download or view the manual from the Motorola website, so all is not lost.Setting up the phone was a breeze. I use Walmart Family Mobile and all I needed to do was transfer my SIM card from my old phone to this one and call customer service to activate the phone on T-Mobile (the service provider for Family Mobile.) It was up and running in less than an hour from when I started.I know the G4 doesn't have NFC, but in the year that I had a phone with that feature I never used it so I do not miss it. I don't anticipate having any problems due to the battery being hardwired--if I needed to remove the battery to reset the phone, then I would start looking for a replacement phone.The bottom line is, I am extremely satisfied with my Moto G4 and foresee a long and happy relationship with this phone.","rating":5},{"id":"RTD3KY7JA0OYI","title":"RUBBISH.

It turns off every single time it rings, which means it can't be used to receive calls anymore... Not that bad? Well, it also turns off when you try to play a video (from youtube or even video messages on Whatsapp), so it's no good as a phone or for entertaining.

Here are my thoughts so far:1)No problem putting it on Page Plus Cellular. Just make sure you take out the included nano sim card tray first, then slide the micro sim that Page Plus supplies. I was up and running within 3 mins of doing that. And to top it off, I had a complicated case. I had to close out an iPhone 4S that was already on Page Plus. Got a CS rep to help me and it was great. 4G on Verizon's network and so far so good. I can even text and receive/make calls with cell data OFF. I do have a T-Mobile sim card as well, so I may try it out on their network to see how that works. There are reports that T-Mobile doesn't alllow WiFi calling on this phone on their network. Will update on that later.2)The phone is very lightweight. It's a budget phone. What more can I say. I did put a case I ordered off Amazon on it, which I will review separately. The case is somewhat clunky and makes the phone VERY heavy. May have to rethink my choice. I also put a Sparin tempered glass screen protector on it. Very nice.3)I was pleasantly surprised that this phone has 2.4G AND 5G wireless connection capability.4)Very impressed with the display. Bright, colorful and full HD. I haven't tried photos or video yet, so we'll see.5)Nice to see little to NO bloatware. Just the basic apps, that's it. One thing I noticed that I'm not sure can be changed is that pressing the Power Button only brings up a choice to Power Off the phone, no Reboot, etc. I'll have to look into that as to why.The battery life seems very good. The turbo charger worked great although the predicted full charge times were off by about 5 mins. Regardless, it seems to be holding charge on par with my iPhone 6S+ throughout the day.All-in-All, not a bad deal of a phone. Just need to find a slimmer case for it.

I can finally begin to like my G4 once more!**Original review**I would give this phone 4-5 stars if it wasn't for one major issue.  Ghost touching makes this phone unusable too often.  Too many times this phone removes or opens apps from my home screen or randomly types characters.  The phone is great when this issue isn't happening, but it happens too frequently.  Unfortunately, the Lenovo forums have been no help.  The only solution they have is to send the phone to India which takes weeks.  They won't state what the fix is, but they do say that it's not a hardware issue.  Those who do send their phones in complain that the problem comes right back.  Why they won't release a software fix or at least tell us what is causing this is pretty shady.  A lot of people are having this problem.  Some say it's only when they are charging the phone.  I notice the issue more so when I'm not charging the phone.  It's very annoying when you get a phone call, but you can't answer the phone because it is going crazy with ghost touches.

I also have a Nexus 6P which takes photos like a really great point and shoot camera, not a smartphone, so I've been spoiled. Once games load, performance is fine.Think of it this way - let's say you have a family plan and four people want big phones. The 5.5\" iPhone 6S Plus with 64GB is currently $849 + tax, so about $910 * 4 = $3,640.00. That's a good used car. Four Moto Gs - even at full price - would run $199 + tax = $214 * 4 = $856... if you do the Amazon promotion price it's $125 + tax = $133 * 4 = $512.  Let that sink in. That's a huge savings for a phone that, again, most users will find little difference in performance and feature set between the iPhone 6S Plus, Galaxy S7 Edge, etc... and in some cases, people will get MORE from Moto G. iPhones don't offer rapid charging, water resistance, or expandable storage just to name a few.

We have used Moto products in the past and was very pleased with their performance.  I know a lot of people are put off now that Lenovo owns Motorola (or vice versa, depending)  but this phone holds true to the minimalist Moto design principle in both physical hardware and software (as close to stock android as you can get without being a Google device, ie, Nexus or Pixel).  The phone worked right out of the box once popping the sim card in and has worked flawlessly.  If you are wondering, this phone does have an active FM tuner and active LTE band 12 (700) in the US for T-Mobile users (and it works beautifully).  But most of all is the price.  Don't let reviews claiming the following pull you away from this phone.  It is a budget phone and must be looked at as such.  With that said let me expound on some of the common review issues about this phone.1> The phone is slow.  NO IT IS NOT: Yes it uses an older Snapdragon 625, but it is plenty speedy and responsive for all but the hardest power user or gamer.  With that said, it handles multiple open applications and some light gaming such as Badlands and Leo's Fortune beautifully.2> The screen is awful washed out.  NO IT IS NOT: Yes it is an IPS LCD screen, but at 5.5 inches, unless you hold directly next to a Samsung S8 or LG V20, you will never tell the difference.  It gets plenty bright and colorful.  It even has an option in the settings for vibrant to mimic more of an AMOLED display.  With that said, if VR is your thing, then I would recommend a higher end phone as VR headsets greatly magnify the screen to provide the immersive experience and with that you will notice more of a difference between this phone and a much higher end device, but therein lies the conundrum, if you have the money for a VR headset then you are already looking elsewhere for a phone.(or should be).3>  Cheap Feel  NO IT FEELS GREAT.  Please understand that this is budget phone, so it will not sport all metal / glass construction and with that said, the phone feels wonderful. It feels solid, well built.4> Battery is not huge.  YES AND NO. While the battery is not as big as it's higher end siblings (namely the Moto Droid Play).  Motorola has always had wonderful battery performance (at least in my experience) and this phone is no different. It is plenty to last an entire day, and with a daughter glued to the thing watching YouTube, Netflix and listening to music, it easily lasts her all day till she plugs it in at bedtime.With all that, plus expandable storage, and a price you can't shake a stick at, this phone is hard to beat.","rating":5},{"id":"R1FC6EDX8EOZOX","title":"Pokemon Go phone review I love this phone it is very good for it's price ...","text":"Ok so first off, this phone DOES run Pokemon GO and it does it very well.

First, this phone isn't going to compete with flagship phones in the price range of $500 to $700, but if you are considering purchasing this phone, you probably already know that.  The Moto G is a great phone.  I have used it with T-Mobile, Telcel (Mexico), and Cricket Wireless all with no problems.  Just pop the back cover off, insert the SIM, and BOOM you're good to go.  It's a good size phone, I also have an LG V10 (I love that phone too) and sometimes I put my SIM into the Moto G just because I like the Moto G so much.  The battery life on the Moto G is great.  I can go all day and more on one full charge.  I mean the battery literally lasts all day for me.  Now, I'm not streaming videos or doing Facebook or anything like that.  I mostly send text messages via Google Voice, Whatsapp, and Google Messenger.  I'm not going to lie, I really like my LG V10, but if you are just going to be doing really basic things the Moto G is the way to go.  It only comes with 2GB of RAM, while the LG V10 comes with 4, but the Moto G is running an almost stock version of Android.  There is no bloatware, additional skins, or unnecessary apps to slow this little guy down, so this phone is pretty snappy and responsive.  I think it only comes with a dozen or so Google Apps out of the box.  It supports up to a 128 SD card,  the 13MP camera is pretty decent, you're able to record some nice 1080p HD video, and the Bluetooth works fine.  The only gripe I have about this phone is that the battery isn't removable, my LG V10 does so if the battery dies on this phone, you're pretty much left with no option but getting a new phone.  I've been using the Moto G as my main phone for the past couple of weeks just because I do like the pure Android and battery life on it.  Like I said before, it's not going to compete with the more expensive phones, but this phone is great for a starter phone for a teenager, a backup phone in case you lose your main, or just don't want to lug around a big phone if you know you're gonna be out all day.","rating":5},{"id":"RUE7OSNSH2FR9","title":"The ads are not bad at all","text":"I'm not a tech person, but for the price of this phone and all it can do....... its a steal. Actually, I got mine for $125.00 with the credit offer. The ads are not bad at all. Its on the screen lock. Its more less a notification. Trust me! I really like this phone. Even with all the Amazon apps, its still not loaded with apps that are worthless and slows the phone down! My old Droid Turbo was loaded with tons of crap from Verizon. You will probably need to go to Google Play or Amazon app to download a few things,but thats about it. What I really like is this phone doesn't get super hot like my Turbo did.","rating":5},{"id":"R1GFCT4JTVJQ2K","title":"Was Totally Skeptical Switching From My Samsung S5","text":"I was worried that this phone would be underwhelming. I've have a Samsung Galaxy S5 for over 2 years. After year 1 it was giving me issues so I rooted it. It was good for a while but gave me lots of problems later. I never really loved that phone, sure it was nice but it was like I was supposed to love it. With this Moto G4 I fell in love like in 5 min. It's really  responsive and feels great to use. Flashing to remove ads was ridiculously easy, setup with T-Mobile was easier... just put in your old sim card. It looks and feels great, I am writing this review using it and texting is great. I would always have to correct typos on my s5 because the keyboard was too small and became unresponsive.I understand this is a brand new phone and time will tell how it performs in the long-run so I will update this review after using it for some time. Another point I didn't fully grasp till using it, it feels like and essentially is a quality phone. If you want bells & whistles, I understand but as a concerned power user myself this already exceeds my expectations.*Update 1* After using it for a couple days I still love it. The camera is another surprise because of how good it is. Check out the pics I took with it (of my dog & the field). The front facing camera is really great too, I expected good since it's 5MP front camera was an upgrade from my 2MP front camera on my S5 but again it's better than I thought it would be.Also, for those who installed the Google app and don't like the search bar on top you can use another launcher like Nova and uninstall the Google app but still keep the 'Okay Google' feature my keeping or installing Google's 'Voice Search' app (the little microphone icon). If you still want 'okay google' to work on any screen just enable that in the settings, no bar on top of the home screen or anywhere. The other alternative is to unlock your bootloader & root your phone.","rating":5},{"id":"RK3F5CDDPZF99","title":"Good phone for the money","text":"I bought this phone a few days before it was released but did quite a bit of research on this models specs., and also some earlier models. It all looked good. I received this phone and was pleasantly suprised at the nicely made phone and plenty of features. I have had a Samsung for years but just didn't want to put out 7-9 hundred dollars for a new one. So far at more than a month I have nothing negative to say. I have the 32 gig model, and added a memory card. I like the way you can twist twice with your wrist and the camera app pops up. No need to search for app. Decent pictures 13mp. Better than my old Samsung Note 2. I like how it easy it was to move apps and data over from old phone. I have att but this phone is unlocked and also works on most carriers. Sure you can get a better phone but not for the price. Very happy with my decision to purchase.","rating":5},{"id":"RH8PS4X3MKWUP","title":"Perfect replacement phone","text":"Phone can't get any better for the price. It takes good pictures and does pretty much everything I need it to do. I thought the ads would annoy me, but I almost never even notice them. Amazon preloads a lot of apps on the phone (obviously), but I use them all so it is not a big deal. I have had this phone for about 6 months and it is starting to fall apart now, but that is OK because it is not an $800 phone. The volume button and power button both fell off, I currently have the power button taped on with scotch tape that I replace every 2 weeks. The apps on the phone sometimes run poorly and force quit when the phone runtime is too long - like a couple days. I really can't complain this has been a great replacement phone when my contract was not up for another year. I am even still using it until it really dies just so I do not have to be paying for a phone monthly. The battery is really good and I only need to charge it once a day for a few hours. Granted I do only use my phone 1 - 4 hours a day (which is nothing compared to most people). If I had to go back when my HTC died I would choose this phone every time. I would give it 5 stars if it was built slightly better, but I do really like this phone. The size is also perfect.","rating":4},{"id":"R2Y3X5LZGQR50X","title":"Best $200 Phone","text":"Lets start this review with what you are getting for the money. First off you are getting a 1.5 gHz octacore processor with a decent gpu (adreno 405), a 5.5 FHD (1080x1920-401ppi) display that gets plenty bright in the daylight sun, 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of internal storage, a 3000 mAh battery, quick charge or as Motorola calls it turbo charge, a 13 MP camera with dual tone LED flash, a front facing camera with 5 MP, and a clean uninterrupted build of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow.So now that we got the specs out of the way lets go ahead and get to what really matters; real life usage. So I bought this phone because I needed a quick replacement. I was rocking a BLU Life One X and it was a good phone with terrible manufacturer software support. So I go rid of it. I then was using an LG K7 that was nothing more than a backup phone for a short while until I got a new one. I am a broke college student so I wanted to make sure I spent my money wisely. I read reviews on this device saying that it doesn't have a premium build, it doesn't the most features, and it doesn't have this and it doesn't have that. Well when it comes down to it this phone works great. The overall usage of this device is quite strenuous. I watch an ungodly amount of YouTube on my free time, I play this game where you walk around and find mythical animals and pretend to catch them (ahem), and I also use this phone pretty heavily for texting, email, video chat, and phone calls. I may be a broke college student but I am one who is busy and needs a solid phone when my laptop is not accessible. This device breezes through the basics and the more demanding things with no hiccup. I attribute this to a couple of things. First off in the decent processor. In reviews you will hear that the Snapdragon 617 is underpowered and that it just lags terribly often. I have not found this to be the case. I haven't experienced any noticeable lag or stutter. I also attribute the smooth performance to Moto's software choice. They didn't add a bunch of extra features or gimmicks. They simply gave us stock Android with some basic additions that should be on every phone such as chop twice for flashlight, and twist the wrist twice for camera. That is why this phone works so flawlessly. Now lets talk about battery life. The first day I got this device I was not satisfied with the battery performance because it seemed to drain very fast. Now that I have had the phone for about a 1 and half to 2 weeks the battery life has managed to last from about 8:30 in the morning to about 11:30 at night with about 30% battery left. I consider this very good because I am relatively heavy user. Even if you do use more battery than me Moto supplies a turbo charger in the box which charges my phone from about 15% to 75%-80% in about 30 minutes or less. In other words battery life is not an issue. When it comes to the display I found it to be more on the warm side, which I like because the colors look very true to life. It's not groundbreaking but it is beautiful. Camera performance has also been very good. While it won't be knocking the Galaxy S7 off the top anytime soon, this is the best camera in the $200 price range. In good light pictures look very, very good and sharp with more than enough detail. Don't expect amazing low light pictures though for sub $200. Front facing camera does what it is supposed to do and will take good selfies for those narcissistic people in your family. The speaker on this device is also surprisingly good. It is a single firing front facing loud speaker that gets plenty loud and has very clear and rich sound. If Moto could have added one more on the bottom since there is not fingerprint scanner this would just be the icing on the cake. Now for the price point and the market I understand why people don't like the build of this phone. It used to be that you needed to spend upwards of $600 in order to get a premium metal body or a \"glass sandwich\". You no longer need to however. However I find this device to well out perform other phones at this price range. And in any case, the build on this device is solid. It may be all plastic but I think that this phone can take quite a few drops. It also feels very good in the hand.So what is my final verdict. I think that this device is the best $200 dollar phone that money can buy. I also think this is the longest lasting phone that money can buy in this price range for one simple reason....updates. All of these other $200 phones may be slightly more feature rich to start, but when this phone gets updated to 7.0 Nougat the others will be in the dust. It is a simple phone that does a lot of things well.","rating":5},{"id":"R35LT0W268S0EO","title":"I like it, but it's occasionally glitchy.","text":"I like this phone a lot.

Over all, it's been a decent phone, but I have to dock a star for the occasional glitches.Update: As of March 31, 2017, the phone actually got updated to Nougat! Huzzah!

It also shuts off randomly regardless of how much battery is left, especially if I'm on a phone call. At this point, I just want to know if my warranty is still valid to potentially get a replacement because the phone is almost unusable at this point.

Worth every penny of the two hundred at launch but I got it for 130 with prime and that was a steel.

I work in a factory for 10-11 hours a day and I play Pandora the whole time.

From a major brand name. You just can't find anything better (07/2016).A few months back, OnePlus (OnePus - X) appears to be the champion of the bargain mobile arena. But not anymore.**Below you'll see a list of phones I am currently and actively using. And this is where I draw my review from.The very first Lenovo Motorola attractive offspring - With this 4th iteration of once less than stellar Moto G phone. It is no longer just a \"who cares, its a Moto G\" phone anymore. The screen is more than exceptional. Beats all phones within its targeted market (<$200). The 1920 x 1080 Full HD display, dare I say superb (for its price). The CPU, Its a Snapdragon big.SMALL eight cores (4 sets) 617 64bit ARMv8 processor is no slouch neither. Don't let the model number fool you. It beats any ARM-v7 (32bit) without any apology, you just got served son. The main attractiveness of this CPU is it's ability to selectively choose a lower power CPU sets for less power demanding operation (e.g. web browsing, texting, etc) and automatically switch over to the more capable CPU sets when the demand arises (e.g. gaming, video, etc). The A-GPS is a blessing in disguised, without a dedicated GPS chip. You no longer have to be constantly mindful of the battery being obliterated due to it's power demand. Where a typical phone will go from 100 to 10% power within minutes (40 minutes) of continuous GPS usage. This Moto 4G will never suffer that dilemma (Playing Pokemon-Go will last for hours without worry of running out of battery). If you spend 99% of your time within a cellular signal covered area. You'll have nothing to worry about. But If you do drive, you are better off getting a dedicated GPS unit. The battery lasted an entire day and the included Motorola Turbo15 fast charger makes recharging this unit a breeze, when the need arise. The speakers are fine, the cameras (front/back) are fine for its price. It is also running the latest (07/2016) iteration of  Android Marshmallow (v6.x) and Motorola's Android built near AOSP with no bloatware. Coupled with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, makes this a very compelling unit. Along with Amazon Prime member's Amazon lock screen ads discount ($50 off retail). Making the decision to purchase this phone a no brainer. Even without the discount, with such an attractive specs and aggressive pricing, it is just as attractive of a phone. Goodbye OnePlus-X, Hello Moto G4. There is a new king in town.The only complaint I have is I can't have more than one of this gem of a phone since it is limited to one unit per one Prime account.List of all my actively and concurrently running devices.

A word of caution to perspective buyers - If you plan to unlock, root and customize it, avoid the Amazon Prime version. It is no longer possible to root and customize that version.UPDATE 12/17/2016 - Three and a half months of ownership and I am as satisfied with this phone as I can be.

I've had it a few months and barely notice the ads anymore. My only complaint is that it gets wonky if you use a charging cable other than the original one it comes with. Specifically, it will occasionally act as if you're touching all over the screen, it randomly clicks things, the upper drown down menu opens, and it's basically unusable. It doesn't happen all the time, but often, and only when it's plugged in. After some Googling, it seems to be a pretty common problem with this phone. Other than that it's great. The app icon sizes are strangely large, but you can get launcher apps to change the appearance and either way it's not obtrusive.EDIT: had this phone for about 6 months now and the problem I mention above has gotten much worse, and now happens whether or not it's plugged in for charging. I notice it happens more when I'm in sunlight or outside, or for some reason the phone gets very hot. It's super frustrating.","rating":4},{"id":"R1GO3ZL55QWENV","title":"Good Performance for a Good Cost","text":"When I noticed many people comment about this phone not being compatible with Verizon or another provider that I use, PagePlus, I was a bit worried. I researched into phones prior to purchasing this and I saw that the older models of this phone worked well, so I thought why shouldn't this work through the service providers too?Well I purchased a PagePlus Sim card, which you will need. I didn't even bother using a Verizon sim card. And I previously had a very old phone (Droid X) and yes you can go ahead and taunt me, but it served its purpose and I was able to use the pay as you go service which was perfect for my needs. Unfortunately I am not able to use that service on the new 4g LTE phones, however the great news is that this phone was incredibly easy to get setup with PagePlus.The phone is certified through PagePlus and yes the sim card I purchased directly through Amazon was also certified. I was also able to port my phone number without a hitch. The phone gets great service and I like how easy it is to switch off the data usage from the service provider and use wifi instead.The Amazon adds aren't intrusive and if you're REALLY bothered by them, then just get a launcher like Nova Prime. For now I like the stock launcher on the phone as I don't really add too many things to the phone in order to maintain a clean and functional system. I don't particularly like how big the phone is and I don't like how it gets a lot of smears on it. I suggest ordering a plastic screen protector for the phone or perhaps a stylus if that's more to your liking. I'll have to return a year later to see how the performance holds up, but right now in the early goings, it's a really nice upgrade for me.","rating":5},{"id":"R32CHDHZ7HAHNK","title":"Great value and very functional.","text":"My phone needs are modest, calls, texting, email, occasional video chat, web browsing, social media, occasionally a puzzle game; and the phone works flawlessly for all those things. Internet forums kept saying that 2GB memory is not enough for a functional phone but the Moto G4 is peppy enough for me and my daughter likes it too. The ads are not intrusive, they appear only on the lock screen and I hardly notice them; and occasionally they are even of interest. The downside of this phone is it is loaded down with bloatware and every amazon app imaginable but doesn't really have enough space left over to be functional unless you also buy an sd-card. The camera is decent in daylight or in bright indoor light but struggles in low light.A word of caution, I tried buying one for my daughter from amazon warehouse and after buying and returning 3 phones, gave up and bought her something else. The first one was google locked. The second was a Play in a G4 box. The third phone stopped charging after a couple weeks.","rating":4},{"id":"R2O79B9CC4OLNR","title":"a poor product","text":"Frankly very surprised at how poor a product this phone is. I've returned it. I've used Motorola androids for years and like their phones, but this one's a dud. It looks great but doesn't work. Basically it does the 'ghost touch' thing. The phone's home button presses itself repeatedly and vibrated without me touching the screen. It did this so much that I couldn't even power down the phone. And yes, it also does the ghost touch thing when booted into 'safe' mode.A reason perhaps it sells for just $200.","rating":1},{"id":"R21NGLZY9PF7K0","title":"A great bargain to replace older flagship phones","text":"I bought this phone to replace a HTC One M7, which at the time it was purchased was definitely a flagship phone. Comparing apples to oranges isn't exactly fair, but as many are likely looking for a bring your own phone, I'll keep with this comparison as it likely matches options that people are considering.The large screen can take some getting used to; while I generally like the slightly smaller size of the previous generation of phones, adapting to the larger phone didn't take much effort at all. Just understand where you used to put your phone might not fit anymore, you'll need an extra half inch of space when you count a case.Sound quality is of course dramatically worse than the One series. Little can beat those little speakers. Photo quality is about equal, battery life is a full day of good use. The lack of NFC is a wash for me; using a phone for payment takes longer than pulling out the card.But of course, the question of the moment, how does it work playing Pokemon Go? Last night I was at Downtown Disney with more than 5,000 other players, and while they were staring at the log in screen, I was playing the game. The newest generation of radios makes a tremendous amount of difference, to the point that I set up a mobile hot spot on this phone so that three other phones (2 Nexus 5's and the old HTC One M7) could continue to play while everyone else waited for their networks to work.Mind you, all four phones were on T-Mobile, and only this one kept a reliable data connection.The ads are unobtrusive, battery life is more than acceptable, speed of loading up apps is reasonably fast, and responsive when opening. Overall, this phone is a bargain when you consider it would take the cost of 3 of these phones to equal the discounted price offered for flagship phones from carriers. All in all, I experienced little performance difference between the M7 and this phone.","rating":4},{"id":"R3FGLSUPTBGAY4","title":"Great phone, great value. No compass though. Ads are OK, only use WiFi, and you can pay $50 to remove them","text":"OK like others have said - the ads are not annoying, the phone has great performance for the price, the camera and screen are fine, and the fast charging is a nice benefit. It even looks OK. Call voice quality is fine and battery life is decent. Overall a great phone for the price.Here are a few things worth mentioning that I haven't seen in other reviews:1. I checked w/Amazon support and they confirmed the ads only download on WiFi, not on your mobile data plan.2. If you got the phone with ads, there is a safe and approved way to remove the ads, and it'll cost you $50. Go to your Amazon account > Manage your content and devices > Your Devices tab > select your phone >  Special Offers and Ads > Edit.3. The phone doesn't have a compass, which seems like an odd omission considering even the $50 Blu phone has that. It still does have GPS and a gyroscope so most games and map apps should be OK, but the lack of a compass could rarely cause problems, for instance the SkyMap app (that shows you the names of stars when you point the phone at them at night) won't work.4. Since this is a new model phone you should take Motorola's claims about carrier compatibility with a grain of salt, for instance their web page lists US Cellular as one of the supported carriers, but as of August 19th US Cellular isn't working, though a Motorola rep told me a month earlier that would be fixed (I didn't get an ETA though). Also if you cruise through the questions posted, a number of users have reported glitches with other major carriers too. I'm sure over time this will all get smoothed out.","rating":4},{"id":"R3W2E8PJXKA8K3","title":"A good phone at a very affordable price.....","text":"Purchased three Moto g3s earlier for friends and they loved it. Jumped at chance to buy the even better reviewed MotoG4 during the introductory sale period. I bought the one with Lock screen Offers & Ads version, which showed up for around 150 bucks. Even though I had misgivings about the ads when I ordered, they proved to be unfounded. The lock screen flicks away with one swipe and it is just like any other phone.The display is a 5.5\" 1080p screen, pretty sharp and once you move the amazon apps to the second screen, you get glorious real estate for your own stuff. The response to inputs are fairly accurate and fast. Android 6.0 is pretty close to stock version and got updated at least a couple of times a.f.a.i.k.It comes with a 13 MP rear and a 5 Mp selfie cameras which obviously cannot be the best around town, do take pretty good pictures, especially with good lighting. I also like the fact that the camera can be turned on with a flick of the wrist.The Moto G4 is a good and practical phone, especially considering the price.I am very satisfied with this purchase.","rating":5},{"id":"R2M0FVR3PNY0Q9","title":"I love that I was able to switch between AT&T","text":"I have the 2nd, 3rd, and now the 4th gen G models.

Disappointed I haven't gotten Android 7 yet and I expected an easier ability to root. Just for those 2 items minus one star otherwise this is a 5 star device.As always never buy the version with ads. That alone will make this a 2 or 3 star phone. Pay extra and get it without the ads if you want a problem free phone.Reduced my rating to one star because still on the end of March 2017 still no nougat update.** Finally got the upgrade today 3/31 to Nougat. Wouldn't you know it, it has the December security patch. You'd think if they were gonna take 4 months to push out the upgrade they would have at least made sure it had the latest security patch. Now I see they released the G5.I wonder how old the security is on that phone. I doubt the next phone with be a Moto.

I also popped my sim card from my iPhone 4s on ATT into this phone and it worked without a hitch.So I've sent back the phone not once,  but twice.  I am currently waiting on my phone to come back.  The issue that came up was that the touchscreen would start going into applications without my input.  It would eventually get stuck on the clock/alarm app.  I did a software reset and it didn't work.  I sent it back the first time in which they sent me back the same phone but without the Amazon bloatware.  I thought this fixed the issue but it didn't.  I had the same touchscreen issues but on a fresh install of the android software.  Now I'm waiting on what they will do next.  Send me a new phone or send me my same phone with the same issues.  It worked well when it worked.  I didn't drop the phone and it was always in a case.I finally received my phone back after waiting two more weeks. It is the same phone but now they replaced the screen and digitizer. This is what I assume. Everything is working fine and now I don't have the Amazon offers and ads on the phone.

I've yet to accidentally click one and they aren't too intrusive. The Amazon apps that came pre-installed and can't be uninstalled annoy me far more than the ads. I can't use Prime Now and don't see it being an option in my location, ever. I have a computer and rarely use Amazon on my phone, so it's just bloatware taking up valuable real estate for me. If you use your Prime Membership for everything it offers, you would probably install most of these apps anyway. I can't get the Alexa app to work. I can't uninstall and reinstall it to try that option. It either won't open or restarts. Not sure what to do about that.As others have mentioned, it does get hot. Setting it up had me a bit worried, but it's yet to get that hot since the initial setup.It's been a major step up from the BLU. The camera, the speakers, the screen sensitivity, and speed are all better. I've noticed no major lagging.Aesthetically, nothing special.The only con for me is how wide it is. I have very small hands and with a case, I can barely get my hand around it. Even without a case it's almost too wide. If you have child sized hands, that may be a deal breaker. If you have normal adult sized hands, I doubt it would be an issue at all.","rating":5},{"id":"R1JVUQ4Y65MZ66","title":"It's good, but there are a few issues.","text":"I really like this phone.  I used to have a Google Nexus 5.  I got pretty used to getting updates from Google and being able to write over the OS myself.  With this phone you don't get that.Supposedly Nougat (Android N) was released to the masses in October or January.  I have 4 of these devices (3 - 16GB models, and 1 32GB model) and none of them have received the update.  It's been a while since we've received security updates too.The phone itself is nice.  The ONE thing I wish it has was a built-in compass -- this helps you with Maps and Navigation.  It tells you which direction you're facing and helps navigation start in the right direction.  Without it, you have to start moving and then it does a course correction for you.The SECOND thing I wish it had was NFC.  This isn't a show-stopper for me, but you can forget about using Android Pay without this.  :(I also wish it had an unlocked bootloader.  I would like to be able to mod the device myself.  I have th version with Ads.  It works well, but I'm getting tired of them after having this for almost a year.  I had expected I might be able to pay some money and have them removed like you can with the Kindle.  Sadly this isn't the case.So, for what it's worth.  That's my review.p.s.  I like the moto gestures -- karate chopping to turn on the light and twisting your wrist to enable the phone.  The speaker works VERY well.  It's fast -- The device has slowed down with external memory, even though the MicroSD I put in it is a Class 10 32GB chip.  The screen is beautiful and the battery life is the bomb!

They just crash and leave the phone useless unless I reset to factory settings.I love the design of the phone, but the OS is just horrible.

I was going to buy the Nexus 6P but then I saw this phone and in terms of specifications, they are pretty much the same except the G4 is much more affordable. My entire family have bought this phone as well. Here are the strengths and weaknesses:✅ Price: inexpensive but definitely not cheap.✅ Battery life: I use my phone a lot and it lasts up to two days. I listen to music, watch videos, use many social media apps, ... and it lasts about 36 hours. Its 3000mAh battery is great. It also takes about an hour to go from 10% to 100%.✅ No bloatware. Unlike Samsung phones, this one looks and functions just like the stock Android. I had the Nexus 5 before this and they are pretty similar. The Motorola features are great though.✅ Screen Resolution: its 1920x1080 screen and 401 dpi is crystal clear. It's also pretty vivid and bright in direct sunlight.✅ Dual sim and microSD. You have the option of choosing the internal memory or the microSD for your photos and downloads. Also you can disable the sim cards individually. You also have the option of turning off their data separately which is great.✅ Good quality: I have dropped the phone a few times (I don't use covers) and it has survived every one of them perfectly. There are small dents here and there but compared to my Nexus 5, this phone is much stronger and robust. Add a cover to it and it becomes much better.✅ Fast: I don't notice much lag. It's really fast.✅ Great picture and video quality.✅ Dual-LED flash. It's fast and not over-powering.✅ Front-facing speaker. This is great because it's louder and doesn't sound muffled at all. Its not the loudest speaker in a phone but its pretty good.✅ Water-resistant but not water-proof. It's safe to use it with damp hands but do NOT submerge it.✅ Lots of cases and covers available on Amazon.⚠️ The built-in camera app is good but lacks many features. For example, it doesn't offer filters, color correction or exposure settings. Its pretty basic but the quality is great. I really like the slow-motion feature. If you are into taking creative photos and edit them, you need a dedicated app. Don't rely on the built-in camera app but the camera itself is great.⚠️ It has a low-profile design. There are no texts on it. Just the Motorola logo on the back cover. If you like something shiny or eye-catchy, this phone is not the right one for you. I personally don't care at all about the looks so it's not important to me.⚠️ No NFC or wireless charging.⚠️ No USB-C charging port.⚠️ The battery is non-removableHope this review is useful.For an in-depth review, you should check out this link:[...]","rating":5},{"id":"R14WCF4A76O5M4","title":"it works great!

I was W-R-O-N-G!I have changed my review from 5 stars to 1. That's right Moto Agents. I just took away 4 stars. It was fine and I had no issues for several months. I purchased 2 of these in October 2016. Both phones are now having the \"jumping screens\". The white one more so than the black one, but both are doing it. I use the white phone. I have done every reset/format under the sun thinking it had to be related to an app I downloaded. It's not. I've read that it does it when you try to use the phone while it's charging. That's true! It does! But it also does it at any other given point in the day. What I have tied it to is swiping the lock screen \"too fast\" which is ridiculous, but it happens almost every time I swipe it fast. If I slowly drag it, it doesn't. At any rate, I have found that you can stop it once it starts, by hitting the power button to black out the screen, then hit the power button again and slowly unlock the screen (I do not have a passcode on mine). Then I can hit the square button and close all the windows of all the crap that opened up on it's own. Much easier than trying to tap things closed while they're jumping all over the place. I will be replacing these phones and going back to Samsung. Not at all happy with these phones.I picked up 2 of these (1 black, 1 white) for my husband and I after his finished off his Samsung Galaxy 5 Active (which was WAY less sturdy than the Galaxy S3). We moved to a pre-paid carrier and I wanted decent phones that didn't cost $700 and didn't add to my monthly cost. I previously had a Blu Studio Energy which has AMAZING battery life, but next to nothing for internal memory and after a year I was over fighting with it just to update an app. I read a lot of reviews and ended up choosing the Moto G4 for our current phones. It's been about 6 months since we got them and I have no real complaints. Minor issue - the camera isn't that great. The phones are actually not as good as what I got on the Blu Energy and it was a lower megapixel. Really it's only an issue with anything at a distance. Anything up close is good, even lower light photos. Typically I have my DSLR when i'm taking most distance photos so it's not a deal killer for me or my husband.","rating":1},{"id":"RETZVIBFQX2JT","title":"Amazing Value, feels like a premium phone, and the Amazon offers are not annoying at all!","text":"This phone is an amazing value.

One of the best features is turbo charge, which charges the battery to 60 % of capacity in 30 minutes. Great feature. However, after 3 months, not only has turbo charge stopped working, but it now takes a day and a half to charge the phone. No problem, sometimes electronics fail, and the phone and components are covered for 1 year.But here is where the love affair with the phone ended. I callled Motorola, and was offered two options. Mail my phone to a service center for repair, leaving me without a phone for 2 weeks. Or, pay $25 plus tax, and they will mail me a refurbished phone. Those are the only options. Keep in mind, the phone is barely 3 months old.I wrote Amazon. I stated that Amazon did nothing wrong, but, I wanted to make Amazon aware how people selling on Amazon, treat Amazons customers.  In two hours, Amazon wrote back, and told me that had created a $30 credit. That is beyond exceptional customer service, totally unexpected, and totally unwarranted by Amazon, but of course, that is why I buy everything I can from Amazon. You buy something, your never alone.Great phone, great Amazon, very poor Motorola customer support. There are companies out there that provide much better support than Motorola.

This was my first BYOP and I was extremely excited about it, and also the most expensive model I sprung for. If I'm correcting for the overall tech trend in Android phones, this was a below-average experience. The pros are pretty much the same as for other phones in its class, but the cons are extremely unique to this particular phone design.Cons: - WiFi turns itself off due to battery saver, and I've come to believe it is not possible to disable this behavior - It will not correctly recognize when the audio jack is plugged in, whereas every other Android phone works right with the same apps - The screen has deep colors at first, but I've actually seen a slight degrading of its quality after 3+ months - It was outrageously picky when configuring the SD card compared to older phones - FWIW, the tracfone BYOP transition experience with this was terrible (probably shouldn't fault the phone for this)Some of my gripes are nit-picky behaviors, but they affect me literally every day. Those small annoyances build up. Regarding the screen, I held it up physically right next to a just-purchased fresh model of a friend's, and I can see clear washing out of the colors in my (older) phone. I've viscerally noticed some deterioration of the color through normal use. Everything considered, I've got the impression that this phone that isn't truly polished to make for a great experience, like other cheap-Android flag leaders from older generations I've dealt with (like the LG Ultimate II). The headphone issue takes me back a generation of convenience using audio-based apps and I actually use my old phones as audio players because managing the SD card and the headphone jack has been horrendous with this phone. It will not automatically start/stop with the headphone plugging in and taking out.It works well in terms of running apps, memory, performance, GPS, connectivity. Camera is basically \"meh\". If you didn't care about saving data due to the WiFi issue (and who would that apply to?), and you don't use headphones like I do, then you may have a 4 or 5 star experience.

When this happens I just reboot my phone and not only will it work but it will have the recent apps I was using before turning off the phone. If anyone knows a permanent fix to this, please do tell.It is very fast, it can handle various apps working at once and it doesn't slow down or glitch in between - My hero!The camera is ok, I haven't spent too much time with it but definitely struggles in low light. I'll try uploading some pictures later.All in all I am so happy with my purchase, especially for the price. I definitely recommend getting a solid case and screen protector, I've dropped it face down a couple of times but it survived with my case and a tempered glass screen protector. Most importantly get one of those rings to attach to the back to get a better grip on the phone.If it helps, I personally purchased these accessories that have made my Moto G4 all the more enjoyable:My CaseG4 Case KAPAVER [ Moto G4 Plus ] Tough Rugged Case Cover - Solid Black Shock Proof Bumper CaseSold by: Silicon Valley Technologies Co., LimitedMy Tempered Glass Screen ProtectorOMOTON Moto G 4th Generation Screen protector [2 Pack] - [9H Hardness] [Crystal Clear] [Bubble Free] Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Motorola MotoSold by: OMOTON MallMy Phone Finger GripLEIMI Universal Phone Finger Grip 360 Rotation Magnetic Car Dash Holder Stand Mount Ring with 3M Double-sided Adhesive Tape to Stable on Any Flat SurfSold by: LEIMI USI have not been reached out by any of these companies, I have not been bribed or endorsed in any way.

Every time I pick it up (from laying flat on table) the thing goes black screen on me and lock screen won't come back unless I shake the phone or press the power button. So not necessarily a big deal except my concern when shaking phone is that it's gonna fly outta my hand. My concern about having to press the power button so often is that the button's gonna break, stick, stop responding, etc.2.  When using the phone NORMALLY - example: web search, using common app like facebook or just moving an app/icon to different screen and only having 1 to 3 apps open at the time - the phone may crash causing the display/screen to bounce/stutter and phone becomes inoperable. This happens TOO often and is very annoying but is fixed by power cycling the phone (easy fix, just annoying if happens too often).Four stars because this phone is sleek, simple to use and has a large display with high resolution.No catastrophic failures and haven't had to remove the back cover except during initial install of micro sim and micro SD card.*****UPDATE*****11/19/2016:  I have discovered that the cause of my phone going psycho (suddenly moving from screen to screen, opening and closing apps and making purchases - all on its own) is due to a defect of the VIBRATION feature. This is a severe hardware defect - it happens where ever you happen to be in the software/apps/browser. If you have the \"vibrate on touch\" feature enabled in settings (enabled by default on my phone) then the phone vibrates constantly, with every touch as you use it and causes the phone to \"flip out\" rather frequently. I disabled everything in settings but the dam phone still vibrates for notifications with no way to stop it and this occurs frequently enough that the psycho defect is still very annoying, especially since, during a recent \"freak out\" it made an in-app purchase before I could press the power button. I saw it change screens in the app then hit buy and then hit confirm. I hope it's just my phone.","rating":1},{"id":"RYKAQY39BYDM4","title":"A new Moto fan after this phone.","text":"I bought this phone because I heard lenovo took over motorola and happen to need a new phone at the time. Lenovo makes really good products so i figured I'd try their phones out, and being on a budget this phone looked extra good. Plus, saving more money on the prime version was a win.You wouldn't think the phone is as cheap as it is when you use it. Feels well made for being at the price point it is, and I'd venture to say that for the money it would be pretty hard to beat. As long as you don't play any hard core games, this phone will easily do everything you need very well.The battery seems to last all day, and I listen to music/ podcast almost all day so I've been really impressed with it. And the screen is also really clear and good for watching videos on. It's not at the resolution the high end phones are at but at 5.5 inches it's pretty hard to tell HD from ultra HD. And finally, the camera seems to be pretty good. I don't notice much difference between this phone and my old phone, an LG G4, which had one of the better cameras you can get in a mobile phone. The pictures do tend to have a warm hint to them but it's not super noticeable.And the \"prime\" version is worth it. The ads really are not that noticeable.","rating":5},{"id":"R2VKMRGJT88Q5Z","title":"IMO, a far better phone than a Samsung, for half the price of comparable specs, and PURE Android!","text":"Yup!

Speeds are comparable to high end phones. Lower RAM makes multitasking difficult.Hi, I never really write reviews for anything but I felt that this warranted a review.I wanted to start with why I bought this phone. I originally had an LG G4 with the leather back and I got the infamous Bootloop error that bricks the phone. I went to target to get a dumb phone to receive phone calls and send text messages. But in less than one day I had smartphone withdrawals and couldn't deal with the fact that I couldn't play pokemon go on my flip phone. So I went on amazon looking for unlocked LG G4 phones, while LG was fixing my original phone and I stumbled on this. I immediately ordered this and had it one day shipped. My plan was to order this and return it when my LG was fixed.I don’t really take pictures and everyone else talks about the camera on the phones anyways, so I’m skipping it altogether. I’m going to try to cover items that I find very important that nobody in the general smart phone reviews seems to talk about.Specs of LG G4:MSRP: $649 ($458.45 on amazon at the time of review)Memory (RAM): 3GBStorage: 32GB (with expandable)Processor: SnapDragon 808Battery: 3000 mAh (with replaceable battery)Specs of Moto G4 (Amazon Ads version):MSRP: $149Memory (RAM): 2GBStorage: 16GB (with expandable)Processor: SnapDragon 617Battery: 3000 mAh (no replaceable battery)As you can see, there is a big price disparity and the biggest difference between the two phones is the RAM and the processor. Storage is not an issue with either phone due to the expandable SD card option.Screen:The screen on the Moto is amazing. I honestly could not tell you the difference between the 4k display on the LG phone and the 1080p screen on the Moto. The only issue I have with the screen is the brightness. I usually keep the brightness at 0%. The screen is much too bright at least for me. I have never turned the brightness above 30%. Even in walking around outside at high noon, there would be no need to go any higher because everything is perfectly clear.This makes the phone not very good right before bed time, when you want a very low brightness so you’re not tossing and turning because of the crazy amount of light hitting your eyes.Speed:I run mostly 6 to 8 different apps a lot. Spotify, Textra (texting app), Pokemon Go, Words with Friends, Instagram, youtube, Jaybird Truesound (Bluetooth) and google Chrome. Everything runs the same as my LG phone. Everything is responsive and quick even with a much older processor (SD 617 vs SD808). I don’t really do high graphics gaming or anything like that, so it may be a lot slower there, I cannot comment on higher processing applications.Multi-Tasking:This is where I have an issue with this phone. On a normal walk outside, I will clear all my apps and run four things: Spotify, PokemonGo, Textra and Bluetooth. On my LG phone (3GB memory) I was able to switch seamlessly between catching my 15th Pidgey of the day and texting then back to my 16th Pidgey (pokemon go for those of you who don’t know what a pidgey is). Spotify will be running in the background streaming music. Everything will be fine.However, on the Moto phone (2GB memory), if I am doing the same thing, switching between pokemon GO, texting and Spotify, my pokemon go will have to restart (about 60% of the time) because the phone cannot handle the amount of items running simultaneously. This should not be a huge deal for most people, but for those of you who switch between a lot of applications, this might present a problem and might be a deal breaker. I haven’t done extensive comparisons, but doing the same thing on my LG G4, I have NEVER run into this issue.Battery:I’ve only had the phone for one week and I got it new, so I don’t feel comfortable talking about the longevity of the battery life on this phone. But I have not run into any issues. It’s hard to beat the LGG4’s replaceable battery (0% to 100% in 30 seconds).Other miscellaneous items:Negative:1. Amazon Ads - These don’t really bother me since they just show up on your lock screen2. Amazon Bloatware – You can’t uninstall these. But if you’re like me, you would have installed these anyways (I’m a big amazon user)3. Icon Size – The icon sizes are much too big for me. Whenever I open the phone, I feel like a senior citizen (I’m 25). The icons are so big, I feel like astronauts could see them from space. I looked up on the internet whether there is a thing in the settings to change this and I have found that you need a third party app to do this. (Only had the phone for a week).4. The AUX jack is at the top of the phone, and the charging port is at the bottom. This is not super obvious from the pictures. But I was surprised by this when I got it in the mail. This might not be a problem for people, but I find it very annoying, I can’t leave my phone in my cupholder in my car and have it charging and playing music.5. Camera takes a while to wake up. I use the twist to camera function and it takes anywhere between 4 to 10 seconds, depending on its mood. This is too slow to capture the moment IMO.6. Stock Android Music App?? I couldn’t find this. Not that I use it, since I’m just on Spotify.Positive:1. There is a feature in the Moto app that lets you flip the phone over on a desk, and it will switch it to do-not-disturb. This is something I’ve never had in any phone. Great for people who work in a quiet office when they need to be productive.2. Great Price.Conclusion:This is a good android phone. I like my LG phone better, it’s faster, multi-tasks betterLG G4, Black Leather 32GB (AT&T) and has a removable battery. But it is $500 more. This is suitable for anybody that isn’t doing high-end gaming on their smartphone or extensive multi-tasking. When my LG phone comes back in the mail. I will keep the Moto in a drawer as my B phone incase anything happens to my LG and have no intention of returning it. Recommend for anybody on a budget who still needs a good smartphone.","rating":4},{"id":"ROHRXAG2Q8FDC","title":"best budget phone for me","text":"after having this phone since it came out it is a great phone, but i made the mistake and bought the lower model when i could have bought the higher plus model, i think its worth spending the extra 50 or so dollars but other than the that the phone does get a little hot when it turbo charges and it doesnt have android nougat YET  but.... with its octacore processor it is really snappy for most the time and can handle most high end games, the battery could last half a day running big apps but can last almost a day and a half using small apps and social mediathe camera is great, even though its only 13 megapixels and not 15 megapixels like other phones, it actually looks like the picture was taken by a higher end phone, the design is sleek and modern and doesnt feel cheap, it is plastic and rubber though, most of the exterior is plastic but the interior is medal so it is durable, talking about the durability it is using gorilla glass so it wont crack or scratch easily so you can but it in your pocket with your keys but dont put it in your tool bag or whatever but it will last you a good two years or a year and a half if you always want the newest techbut if you are not a phone fanatic and dont need it for big things and just need it for basic things like social medias, calling, texting, and basic games, get the moto g4 play, dont waste the money on things you wont use butif you want a fingerprint sensors and a little bit better camera and speed get the moto g4 plusbut if you want all of these things combined get the moto g4this is one of the best budget phones and budget series","rating":5},{"id":"RX7TG9K0ADP8I","title":"I do NOT recommend this phone","text":"Do not buy this phone!

Internet forums kept saying that 2GB memory is not enough for a functional phone but the Moto G4 is peppy enough for me and my daughter likes it too. The ads are not intrusive, they appear only on the lock screen and I hardly notice them; and occasionally they are even of interest. The downside of this phone is it is loaded down with bloatware and every amazon app imaginable but doesn't really have enough space left over to be functional unless you also buy an sd-card. The camera is decent in daylight or in bright indoor light but struggles in low light.A word of caution, I tried buying one for my daughter from amazon warehouse and after buying and returning 3 phones, gave up and bought her something else. The first one was google locked. The second was a Play in a G4 box.

I've had it a few months and barely notice the ads anymore. My only complaint is that it gets wonky if you use a charging cable other than the original one it comes with. Specifically, it will occasionally act as if you're touching all over the screen, it randomly clicks things, the upper drown down menu opens, and it's basically unusable. It doesn't happen all the time, but often, and only when it's plugged in. After some Googling, it seems to be a pretty common problem with this phone. Other than that it's great. The app icon sizes are strangely large, but you can get launcher apps to change the appearance and either way it's not obtrusive.EDIT: had this phone for about 6 months now and the problem I mention above has gotten much worse, and now happens whether or not it's plugged in for charging. I notice it happens more when I'm in sunlight or outside, or for some reason the phone gets very hot. It's super frustrating.","rating":4},{"id":"RRZNL11TLNY0B","title":"DO NOT BUY unless you have a thing for flickering screens","text":"I just received this phone today, and right out of the box, the screen starts flickering.

I don't usually write reviews on phones, but I decided to do so on this phone. I'll break down the pros, cons, and the neutral aspects of the phone.Pros: This phone has excellent battery life. I previously had a galaxy s4 and the battery life was a lot worse. The battery gets me through a whole day and then some.The screen on this phone is awesome. My father and brother both have quad HD displays on there phones and there isn't a whole lot of difference between our phone's screens. The phone also comes with a turbo charger even though it does not state that it comes with one in the description. The front facing camera also takes nice photos, so this would be a nice selfie phone. The last pro that is absolutely amazing and I applaud Lenovo for is the fact that this phone works on ALL phone carriers. You just pop in your sim card and your good to go.Cons: This phone is missing a compass, so certain features are gone such as some virtual reality aps and apps that use direction(separate from GPS). This phone also does not have a removable battery which does not bother me, but may annoy those who are not used to non-removable batteries.The neutral aspects: The phone has a decent back camera and the shots can get muddy at night but the flash definitely helps.","rating":5},{"id":"R2607YL9XVUZ4C","title":"Permanent ghost touch - almost unusable.","text":"I used to love Moto G phones. My previous Moto G3 had been my favorite phone ever. However after about 1-2 months of use I started getting the \"ghost touch\" issue a lot of these reviews are also mentioning: the phone begins to overheat, batteries start lasting less and less, and the screen starts to act by itself, as if being touched by someone who isn't there. These start happening more and more often, very gradually. Now, 4 months after purchase, I get the ghost touch more often than not, which makes the phone almost unusable.Here are SOME examples of what the ghost touch has decided to do on my phone:- From whatsapp chats, added people into my phone's contacts list under the wrong names, so that I have to be permanently be asking people who they are.- Bought random apps from the google play store. Took me a while to notice this as they never actually downloaded. Luckily they were all free apps, but these are all very random things that I do not want.- Called a friend from high school (I'm 25) at midnight on a Tuesday, and then refused to let me hang up until he actually picked up and I had to explain.- Called several other people at random, from family members to acquaintances.- Started playing youtube videos at full volume while I'm at work.- Prevented me from taking pictures, as ghost touch would permanently switch the focus, making them blurry.- Prevented me from using google maps correctly,  as it keeps zooming in/out and/or changing the destinations.- Attempted to send random pictures from my phone to random group chats -> luckily I've been able to prevent these by locking the screen in time.I contacted my local Motorola support and they said that it's a manufacturing issue that has come up in a lot of these phones, which came out wrong from the factory.

For not charging me for my trouble, I added a star, even though I am upset that the phone I will receive is probably older than the phone I bought. I've added a star since Moto actually honored its warranty.I am not sure why the phone broke on me. I used it in the rain ONCE, but I had a screen  protector and case. I have alsoo found while researching google that OVERHEATING IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM, and some cases and even the turbo charger that is packaged with it can make the phone overheat.Moto Tech has even \"solved\" an overheating issue on their forum by telling people not toi use half the features on the phone![...]I cannot believe that thread is actually marked solved! Anyways, I guess you get what you pay for.And now back to my original post from the 8th ,...I bought this phone in August of 2016. I thought I got the bargain of a lifetime. It is a nice looking phone, does everything I asked of it.However, two days ago the thing just stopped working. When I turn it on now I get a \"snowey rainbow\" screen. The icons try to peek through it at times but the phomne is pretty much bricked, after less than three months of use.Apparently Amazon doesn't offer support for this device, so once it's broken it's on you. I now have to attmept to coordinate with Sprint to get this phone fixed. If that doesn't work I'll have to ship it to Motorola and hope the repairs are covered.I do not remember doing anything to damage this phone, outside of using it once for about 20 seconds in the rain. Granted, the phone has a screen protector and case, I do not think it was damaged by water. I also notice the phone gets very warm so maybe heat has damaged it.","rating":2},{"id":"R1BG189R0BC7Q","title":"Abnormal touch screen","text":" I bought this 16 GB unlocked-without ads version.

I got a replacement sent out to me soon after they received my ghost touch phone.  I have restored this phone and have yet to have any issues.  Greatly appreciate that they'll replace the phone instead of trying to fix it since so many people were continually having the issue come back.  Will update after a month since the original problem took about that long to start on my original G4.  I can finally begin to like my G4 once more!**Original review**I would give this phone 4-5 stars if it wasn't for one major issue.  Ghost touching makes this phone unusable too often.  Too many times this phone removes or opens apps from my home screen or randomly types characters.  The phone is great when this issue isn't happening, but it happens too frequently.  Unfortunately, the Lenovo forums have been no help.  The only solution they have is to send the phone to India which takes weeks.  They won't state what the fix is, but they do say that it's not a hardware issue.  Those who do send their phones in complain that the problem comes right back.  Why they won't release a software fix or at least tell us what is causing this is pretty shady.  A lot of people are having this problem.  Some say it's only when they are charging the phone.  I notice the issue more so when I'm not charging the phone.  It's very annoying when you get a phone call, but you can't answer the phone because it is going crazy with ghost touches.  I'll update this review if they ever release a fix.  For now, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.","rating":4},{"id":"R2QITQ5AB8HY1R","title":"Very pleased with standard version","text":"Amazon version is no longer truly unlocked.Motorola will not give the bootloader unlock code for the Amazon version of the phone any longer so the phone cannot be rooted etc.For me that was final deal breaker and the phone went back the first day, I need my phones rooted for apps I run.The standard version I had zero problems getting the code.Also the ads are annoying anyone saying they are not is kidding themselves to the tune of the fifty bucks saved, in the long run I bet they will regret.They may not be overly intrusive but they are constantly running and some cannot be shut off as well, also they will use your data when connected may not be all that much but for some it could be another problem.The phone has a nice data management feature you can see that for your self.The phone is fast powerful and runs cool, no overheating as one or two described.Went with the 16gb version and a 128gb fast micro sd card formatted in phone so now it appears to have over a solid 110gb storage, no more juggling around apps for space marshmallow does it automatically storing app data on the add in card.The catch with that is can only be used in the phone from that point unless you format it back to a standard card, in other words if you took the card out and put it in a reader it would not show anything marshmallow formats and encrypts it for in phone use only.Would be nice to have two sd slots but hey can't have it all for that price.There are not a lot of apps that come built in mostly standard Google stuff, even the Moto file explorer had to enable that through the Google play, I find ES File explorer the best anyway but the Moto one has it's good points.For music and video VLC of course plays everything you can throw at it and is very clean and easy to navigate and make play lists etc.Best part is like it's PC counterpart has zero ads what so ever or any other kind of nags.No NFC, that's kind of a bummer if it had that it would truly be an amazing valueThe Camera I cannot really say much about except for what it is works very well, I have a high end DSLR and lenses so everything less than that looks like crap either way. Yes I am a snob when it comes to that.Very happy with the GPS accuracy and sensitivity locks on just about everywhere, combined with Sygic gps app it works fantastic.For 200 bucks you really can't go wrong with this phone, looks great as well.Oh for me it felt a bit thin some like that but I got a nice case with belt clip and gave it the bulk that feels good in my hands.","rating":5},{"id":"R3SI98L3YK3WS8","title":"Best Midrange phone.  Period! Buy Now!","text":"Simply put.  Best midrange phone for $150 to $250 price range.Biggest plus for me on this phone that is less talked about is the amazing wifi card particularly the 5ghz.  My previous phones were the HTC M9 and LG G3,  and both could only achieve 30 to 50mbs on my 5ghz wifi,  and even worse on 2.4ghz.I was amazed and thrilled the first time I range speed test and found the Motorola G4 did 90mbs!!! Awesome.If you are a prime member,  get the Amazon version of the 16gb.  The ads are nearly nonexistent.  Only show up occasionally on lock screen.  Trust me,  they are not really noticeable.The box and everything about the phone is completely stock.  All apps including Amazon could be uninstalled.The camera is sweet.  On par with my G3 and HTC M9.Also, in Q4,  Android Nougat 7.0 will be pushed to this phone.Tip for buyers....buy the Amazon 16gb version for $150 or less,  and the money saved over the 32gb,  use it to buy a high speed 128gb SanDisk Micro SD card.  Set is an internal memory.  Now enjoy a phone with over 130gb of storage!!!You won't regret this phone.I also highly recommend the Incipio DualPro case.  Best case for less than $15, and feels great in hand.  Offers nice drop protection.  Equivalent to Otterbox Commuter case.Now stop reading more reviews and buy this phone!","rating":5},{"id":"R17AI85AV756JC","title":"BUY THIS PHONE!","text":"I ordered this phone to replace my 2 year old Samsung Galaxy S4 16GB. This phone is great, very pleased with my purchase. I took my Verizon sim card out of the Galaxy S4 and popped it into the Moto G turned the phone on and it works perfectly. I pulled up my Verizon account online and it showed the new Moto G as my device. Super Easy! I also purchased a Samsung Evo Plus 128GB High Speed Micro SD card to expand the phones 32GB storage. The great thing about this phone is you can format the SD Card to the phone's Internal storage. This is a big plus for me as most phones limit the added SD card to external storage which limits you to only having extra storage for photos and music. I keep my photos and music in Google's Cloud so now I can load lots of apps on the phone and not keep getting \"not enough storage\" response like I did on the S4 and would have to delete apps to add apps. The large screen is also an added bonus and the phone still fits comfortably in my front pants pocket (even with a case). I'm still in the learning curve stage and discovering new features but so far so good. If your looking for a great mid price mobile phone this is the phone. Another great feature is this phone is more pure Android than a contract locked phone, so its not bloated with Verizon Apps (my current carrier) and Samsung Apps which I didn't use but couldn't delete, only disable. I also spent a little more $$ for the NO added features/Amazon advertising phone option. I don't want ads on my phone, just my preference and the slightly higher price for this is worth it to me.","rating":5},{"id":"RS5D6PBXNFVRO","title":"I'm In Love","text":"Love this phone!! It is sleek and thin, with amazing features and capability. My husband and I both took advantage of the great Amazon Prime offer, and each paid less than $160 for phones that rival the latest from any other manufacturer out there. I never notice the ads, as once the lock screen is off, they disappear. The AT&T technician who activated our phones couldn't believe how little we paid, and was especially impressed with the camera, which he stated was better than the one on his iPhone 6. We had both put off getting smartphones, and the acquisition of these is comparable to the life changing impact we experienced when we acquired our first cellphones nearly 20 years ago. If you haven't yet taken the plunge, or if you want to upgrade your current smartphone, you can't miss with the Moto G4!!","rating":5},{"id":"RM2ACY12SQY4Z","title":"Great phone, but you might have to root it","text":"I love the phone, and would give it 5 stars, but...On Net 10 Wireless, and maybe other providers, USB tethering and Wifi hotspot functionality is disabled by default.

It has been a great phone. I installed a new battery a month ago (easy). I might have disturbed the front facing camera connector because it stopped working, but it is not worth sending it out for repair, so I bought the G4.The Ads seem to be only on the second screen, so it's not too annoying. I moved my Consumer Cellular (check them out) sim card and Samsung 16 GB memory card to the new phone, and everything works great. I have been an Apple guy since the start, but the price of an an iPhone is just crazy compared to this. I hate everything about Google's intrusiveness, but I can put up with it,and ignore most of it, for this high quality phone.Love Motorola. Had their phones for 10 years.UPDATE:Don't buy this phone until you read the forum on the Lenovo site.These phones are affected by \"ghosting issue\" that they can't solve.

At first I thought I could tie it to a specific app, but then came to realize it was more random than that.
