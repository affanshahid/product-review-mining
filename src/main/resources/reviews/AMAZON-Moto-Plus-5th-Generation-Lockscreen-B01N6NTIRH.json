[{"id":"R1FFJ82TDERSB","title":"LOW VOLUME, POOR QUALITY REAR CAMERA, AND MORE ISSUES","text":"I'm switching from a Iphone 6S and there is no comparison. And I know, I'm very aware that they're different phones at a different price, but I was expecting a better phone than what I got.First off, you have to press the fingerprint button twice in order to access the phone. I missed four phone calls already.Sound is very low and the speakerphone is low as well,When listening to voice mails, when switching to speaker phone, there is a big delay before the sound comes on, and I also hear some noises in between.I understand that the ads are there in order to get a discount but they very are annoying, instead of looking at a beautiful picture of my family as a wallpaper, I see fricking ads.The Iphone 6S charges itself much faster.If you get a text, once you open the cell phone, the text icon DOES NOT SHOW any marks stating that you have a text message. So if you don't hear the sound for a text message, you won't notice that you have a text (s).I did setup a PIN # as well to unlock the cell besides the finger print, however when I tried to use a different finger I couldn't get to the screen to use the PIN to unlock it. I was trying to unlock it in case that the fingerprint reader fails.The only other thing I got was a choice to make a 911 call (emergency only).Camera is awful (rear), poor quality. Pictures are almost the same quality as of my very old Samsung Galaxy Avant,seriously.BTW, I also have a Fire phone that takes better pictures than this phone and has decent sound.I choose this phone because the finger reader in the front, I was expecting a decent camera but I'm disappointed.Bottom line, I want to like this cell phone but its a letdown.I'm not an expert, this is only my opinion but I'm aware of the issues I have already experience with one day of use.And for sure I'm not a paid reviewer.Update: I'm having issues with people sending me text messages when they use Iphones. Tmobile tried everything with negative results, they even switched Sim cards.I receive text from Android cell with no problems.","rating":1},{"id":"R79BJLK5X0IB9","title":"Absolute Crap - Eats SIM cards, useless phone, AND number off the air.","text":"Total PoS.

Mine is the 4GB version with 64GB/4GB with no ads.Phone looks nice physically.  The right size for me, shiny.  Calls sound great. Fingerprint scanner wakes and unlocks the device instantly.Display is sharp and bright.  Performance is excellent.  Battery at 56% after using it all day, recharges very quick with the included turbo charger.  I think it's likely the battery will still be bearable after three years of wearing down.Camera works fine, launches fast and with a shake. Pix are nice and bright, snaps fast, great detail.Loads and runs all my apps just fine.  The new version of Android is quite nice.Had some trouble getting it to work right with AT&T, but that's not unexpected on launch day.My previous phone was Nexus 5, which was damaged and lost. If it wasn't either of those I'd probably still be using it.One thing I don't care for is that this phone is \"checking subscription status\" with AT&T when enabling hot spot or Bluetooth Internet sharing.  This is a feature of my device, not the network.  I pay for the data and it's none of their business what I use it for.  My Nexus didn't do this.  After some time I'll probably flash the phone's software to something more obedient just for this.  But I expect this is pretty standard on a smartphone.  I also don't care for audio on the startup animation.The price is excellent for this much phone.Summary: I think I'm going to like this phone for quite a while.  I would prefer the Pixel, but no way am I paying anywhere close to that much money on a phone that will almost certainly be broken lost or stolen.","rating":5},{"id":"R1AO93W4PAPUG3","title":"Great phone, no compaints.

The camera also has a fast shutter and takes incredible pictures when the lighting is just right. The SIM and SD card tray is a little odd until you figure out what's going on, but once you figure it out and slide the tray back in, the phone recognized both no problem. Pretty much stock Android with a few Moto quirks (twist for camera, flick for flashlight) that don't bog down the phone like Samsung software tends to do (my old Galaxy S6). Android 7.0 is its own review, but considering my last Android was 5.0, the newer features are very welcome.Two things I'm sure people want to know:1 - This works on T-Mobile no issues; didn't have to call anyone or anything like that, plugged in the SIM and off I went.2 - My version is the Prime Exclusive with lock-screen ads. Basically, the difference between this and the standard version ($60 more) is twofold: mine came with Amazon's apps pre-installed on the phone, all in their own folder and the lock-screen will almost always have an ad. If you have no notifications, it will be a full screen ad which can be swiped away; if you have notifications, it will just be another notification, always below your main notifications, that can also be swiped away. These ads don't interfere with your ability to get into your phone instantly and don't interfere with notifications or checking the time.","rating":5},{"id":"RZZ9M88VGK89I","title":"Great phone at a Great Price","text":"I love this phone ...

Took the local store all of ten minutes to get the number ported over from T-Mobile and establish my account and, within two hours, I was receiving text messages on the Moto G5.Hardware Impressions:--The Moto G5 Plus arrived in a tiny package, which contained the phone, a charger, USB cable and a tool for opening the SIM card/SD card tray. SURPRISE--This is the first phone I've purchased that did not come packaged with earphones.--The phone feels very light. Too light, in fact, and I wish it had a bit more heft to it.--The protruding camera in the back is something that initially feels weird and will probably take some getting used to.--Both the volume up/down and power button are on the same side (right side) and clustered fairly close together. I find this unintuitive and, have already pressed the volume botton when intending to press the power button.--Device came with 80% of battery charge. [24 hours later, after moderate use and no charging, battery charge shows 50%]. Excellent.--Display is sharp, bright and clear. Zero complaints.--The sim card tray is, in a word, weird. Complicated might be more apt. One side houses the removable micro SD card; and the other side houses the dual nano sim cards. This means you cannot remove/change the micro SD card without interrupting the phone functionality. Bummer.  The other bummer has to do with the Amazon Prime Exclusive version--one of the nano sim card slots has been physically blocked. The manual that came in the box clearly shows two nano sim card slots, so it seems as though the phone nativiely supports dual sim cards.--The power button is used to turn off the display (short press), or, upon long press, to power off the device. This might be Moto specific behavior? On my prior devices, I've always used long press on the power button to enter airplane mode or reboot or power off.Initial Setup:Supplied two credentials--one for the gmail account and another for Amazon. Chose to sync up to backed up apps and settings and, within minutes, all the apps that I had on previous devices were reinstalled.  All Google related app settings got restored fully as well, including things like Chrome favorites, music library, Google Drive contents, Photos albums and pictures, etc, etc.APPS:Very light on pre-installed apps. Besides the aforementioned Amazon apps, the following two are notable--the Moto app and the Device Help app. Since this is my first time on a Motorola Android device, both are proving to be quite helpful in helping me understand device specific features.Amazon Prime Exclusive Info:1. The lock screen does show Amazon ads. I'm still getting used to its presence, but I will say that it can be dismissed with a simple flick of the finger.2. The paper manual that accompanied the phone shows dual sim slots. However, the second nano sim slot has been blocked off in the tray. This leaves me wondering if the \"standard\" sim card tray (if one could purchase one) for this device would in fact enable the dual sim cards functionality and allow the device to manage two active phone numbers?  Will look into this in the days to come.3. During the initial device setup, you need to supply the Amazon credentials. [Correction: this step is optional.]4. The device comes pre-installed with a suite of Amazon apps--Amazon Music, Prime Photos, Audible, Amazon Drive, Prime Now & Alexa--all grouped inside an easily recognizable \"Amazon\" folder on the base home screen.  All of these can be DISABLED but not uninstalled, it seems.5. The home screen initially had a pre-installed Amazon app widget that showed daily deals and also took up the top third of real estate. Thankfully, it's very easily removed--long press on the widget and drag it to the trash.  This might be a boon to folks who like to shop on Amazon.Overall Impressions:This is a fast device, both in processing and signal speed. At home, am able to connect to the 5GHz WiFi; and, outside, I'm getting LTE everywhere (but that's typical of Austin area on pretty much all carriers).  From Google Maps to Chrome, haven't seen any delays. Everything happens instantly. The few times I viewed youtube videos when outside, they loaded very fast and playback was smooth. This speaks well of both Cricket Wireless and this device. That said, after 24-hours with the device, I'm lowering the rating from 5 to 4 stars. It's a good device for the money.","rating":4},{"id":"RD1WWQJLS887","title":"A Much Better Phone than The Moto G4 and G4 Plus!","text":"Amazon is sure to have another hit on their hands with the release of the Moto G5 Plus! It’s a much better phone than its predecessor phones, the Moto G4 and G4 Plus. The 5.2” screen size make it a lot easier to use than those 5.5” older models. It feels more premium than the G4 series with its new aluminum construction. The G5 Plus has Android Nougat on it as opposed to Android Marshmallow on the G4 series, so you have the latest operating system!One of the nicest surprises I’ve had with this phone is the ease in getting it to work with my Verizon prepaid account. I’ve been using my Verizon account with a Verizon prepaid Moto G Play. I’ve heard a lot of horror stories of people trying to get an “unlocked phone” capable of working on both prepaid and postpaid Verizon accounts like the Moto G4 and G4 Plus, as well as the unlocked version of the Moto G Play to function!!!! All I did, was pull my Verizon nano sim out of its micro sim adapter and stick it into the Moto G5 Plus (which uses nano sims) and turned it on. As soon as I started the setup process, I could tell the Verizon Wireless prepaid sim was working perfectly! What a relief! I went on my laptop and logged into my Verizon account and checked “Device”. It correctly showed the model number of the Moto G5 Plus which is XT1687! This is major - if you’re planning on using this phone on Verizon! AT&T and T-Mobile and their MVNOs should give you no problem!Since I've only had this phone for a few hours, I've only taken a few snapshots with the camera, but when I checked them out, I was surprised at how nice they came out! From reading some online reviews, it seems that Lenovo/Motorola decided to go with the same camera module that the Samsung S7 uses. The only difference is that this module doesn't have the optical image stabilization (OIS) that the S7's module includes, so you'll need a steady hand for videos. But you'll get the \"low light\" benefits of a much more expensive phone for your night shots. That's a plus!The phone has good \"hand feel\" as a naked phone, but I always buy covers and screen protectors to keep my phones as pristine as possible. I’ve picked up some TPU cases like this: Moto G5 Plus Case, Diztronic Full Matte Slim-Fit Flexible TPU Case for Motorola Moto G5 Plus (5th Generation, 2017) - (Full Matte Teal Blue) and the no-brainer TPU bargain: Moto G5 Plus Case, SPARIN [2 Pack] Soft TPU Case for Motorola Moto G5 Plus 2017 with [Corner Protection] [Crystal Clear] [Scratch Resistant]  I ordered a 6-pack of these: Motorola Moto G5 Plus Screen Protector [6-Pack], Klear Cut HD Clear Screen Protector for Motorola Moto G5 Plus PET Film Anti-Bubble Shield and a 64 GB micro SD card: SanDisk Extreme 64GB microSDXC UHS-I Card with Adapter (SDSQXVF-064G-GN6MA) [Newest Version], which I’ll keep as external storage rather than adoptable storage …given that the phone has 64 GB onboard.I ran a couple of benchmarks to assess the difference between the G5 Plus and my G4Antutu:  Moto G4  42297  Moto G5 Plus  60718Geekbench: Moto G4  Single Core 686  Multi Core  2894  Moto G5 Plus Single Core  844  Multi Core  4215The Snapdragon 625 in the G5 Plus is a nice bump up from the Snapdragon 617 in the G4. I'm not much of a game player, but I suspect the G5 Plus will be able to play most games at decent frame rates!I’m sure there’ll be people drooling over the new Samsung S8 and S8 plus in the next few days, but if you want to save a bundle of money and still have a decent phone, this one looks like a winner!If I have any problems over the next few weeks, I'll update this review!","rating":5},{"id":"R30URDO81SJPPG","title":"Great phone.

The size is perfect for my hands, not 5.0 but 5.2 and I like the 4GB of RAM so I can load main apps and multitask.  I just realized that they included DUO app.  After playing around with DUO, I didn't realize that I can make video calls between Android and Apple IOS devices!!!  DUO works like a charm over WIFI and people can actually call each other and the video was crisp.  I have yet to test it on a cellular network but I don't think it will be that good but worth a try.  I would check the reviews on DUO because that came out last year but I notice that Google made significant upgrades to DUO product to make it work better as a simple video mechanism.  Half of my family is obsessed with Apple IOS and the other half is obsessed with Google Android.  Is DUO a game changer, not really but it will crush Apple philosophy that no calling to or from videos outside of Apple's own property.","rating":5},{"id":"R19ZQZROPZ2D7B","title":"Can't beat it for the price!","text":"I received mine yesterday...64gig.

My first impression was that the quality is as good as a high end phone, costing hundreds more. My only complaint would be the protruding camera, easily remedied by a case of some sort but overall I'm impressed. The finger print scanner extends the length but is well worth the trade off. The finger print scanner works very well. It can be set up for two different fingers to unlock it. Perfect for unlocking face up with your index finger or thumb while holding it. I came from a Droid Turbo so the moto actions I had come to depend on was a must. Twisting the phone to open the camera might sound insignificant but I'm normally taking pictures while my friends are hunting their camera app. I haven't tested the camera enough to comment yet. The set up on Verizon was super smooth. I removed the sim card from the Turbo and inserted into the Moto G5. The sim tray is confusing because it is combined with the sd card tray. At first I thought the sim wouldn't fit but I was putting it into the sd card slot. My signal seems to be a strong 4g signal and call quality has been better than my Turbo. The speaker isn't a Bose by any means but adequate. If you use Android pay or any NFC functions this phone is not for you. There is no NFC, one lacking function. The speed of the phone is awesome. Faster than my Turbo, the Verizon flagship a couple of years ago. The auto brightness on the screen keeps the screen quite dark but it probably helps with the good battery life I have gotten so far. I use a custom launcher which removes the auto Amazon folder on the desktop. The Amazon ads are not intrusive at all. Not an issue for me. Overall the phone performs well.

Camera has no link to view your images in your gallery, I hope they will add this on an update later because I have never had a phone that did not have this option.4.

The phone has two major SIM Tray design flaws noted in the Cons Section below.Pros:+ Nice crisp screen;+ Battery lasts a full day and takes roughly an hour and 10 minutes to fully charge from a 10% charge;+ No Bloatware;+ Comes with Android Nougat 7.0 unlike phones still being released with earlier versions of Android;+ Nice metal build quality that feels almost premium;+ The phone takes a nano SIM which is more or less standard.  The 4th Generation G Plus took a larger SIM card;+ Has a headphone jack; and+ Speakerphone is decent.Cons:- Instructions to install the SIM card are WRONG as another reviewer notes.  You have to insert the SIM card upside down which can scratch the metal surface of the SIM card on the phone body rendering the SIM useless.  The SIM card seems to get stuck in the tray housing it unless you force it to seat properly.  This makes it easier to break the thin plastic tray;- The SD memory card has to be installed upside down, as well.  It sits on the opposite side from the SIM Card and trying to install both at once is very difficult because one will fall out since they are on opposite sides (top and bottom).  The way Lenovo engineered this is baffling;- Need to place your finger on the fingerprint scanner twice to unlock the phone; and- The camera is just OK; low light pictures look grainy, unfocused and blurry.  Daytime pictures look like something out of the iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy S5 generation.The phone arrived with an 85% charge.  You do not to update the operating system as of the time of this writing. I got the Amazon Version and all Amazon apps. are installed.  Not a big issue as I'm an Amazon fan and use their apps. on an everyday basis.  You can't bypass the ads on the lock screen by using the fingerprint scanner.  You can store multiple fingerprints in case you are getting the phone for a child and need to perform your parental due diligence from time to time.  Google apps. are also pre-installed.  Nothing else (bloatware) comes installed on the phone which is very nice.The Moto G5 Plus Case, Cimo [Shockproof] Heavy Duty Shock Absorbing Hybrid Protection Cover for Motorola Moto G5 Plus (2017) fits the phone perfectly and adds OK protection.Of note, I had to change the phone Access Point Name (APN) settings to make it work with 4G on T-Mobile.  Out of the box, the phone only worked with T-Mobile 3G. The SIM card is brand new so this has nothing to do with the SIM being an older technology.  An APN is a gateway between a GSM, GPRS, 3G or 4G mobile network and another computer network. A mobile device making a data connection must be configured with an APN to present to the carrier.If it weren't for the major SIM and SD card design flaws, I'd rate this phone a solid four stars.","rating":3},{"id":"R32YMY33XNEIXQ","title":"Love from an average user","text":"My old phone was dying so I spent about two weeks researching the options for phones and learned about this awesome new phone. This phone is super easy to use. I had a Fire phone and while I loved it there were several problems. I know that most any phone would have been an improvement for me. I love how intuitive it is to use. While watching reviews I came across someone wishing that the speaker was louder. I certainly don't foresee any issues with the sound at this point. My phone now works well in my house, same service as yesterday, I didn't realize having a new phone could make that much difference. The pictures I have taken so far of my kids in the low light of my living room make me extremely happy. If things change I'll try to update my review but I'm very pleased!","rating":5},{"id":"R26BFUXKB52KTU","title":"Well built, responsive but lacking quality rear camera","text":"I received the phone about 8 hours ago from Amazon. I have been playing around with it since then. The phone has a screen size of 5.2 inches, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB storage, 12 MP rear camera and 5 MP front camera.Initially, I was disappointed with the screen space available. But then, I got rid of Android's standard navigation buttons and enabled the fingerprint navigation. This freed up a lot of space on the screen and I am fine with the screen space now. Although, I must say that I would personally prefer a phone that is 5.5 inches or more.The phone has been very responsive to touch and I have been able to run multiple apps and switch between them without noticing any lag. Note that I am using the one with 4 Gb of RAM. The fingerprint sensor has also been working great without any noticable lag.I am a bit disappointed with the quality of the pictures that the rear camera clicks. I found the pictures a little washed out and on the softer side. However, I did like the quality of the selfies that the front camera clicks. I am also not comfortable with the rear camera protruding slightly at the rear. I may probably get used to it though.I was also surprised by the fact that the phone comes without NFC which will prevent me from using Android Pay at checkout in stores.I am hoping that Motorola/Lenova will be quick with bringing Android updates to the phone (fingers crossed).To summarize, the phone is well-built (besides the protruding rear camera), responsive, has a fast fingerprint sensor, a good front camera for selfies but a slightly disappointing rear camera that produces washed-out images. I will give the phone 4 stars (for not coming up with a better rear camera and skipping NFC).","rating":4},{"id":"RZVO54PSUGVN8","title":"I got the gold","text":"I am in love with this phone. I had the original Moto G and now I'm back again. Phenomenal camera and the phone is great.","rating":5},{"id":"R38KK9PU18BPTJ","title":"So good!","text":"This phone rocks. Multitasking works great, processing speed is great, and the camera is great. I'm switching from an iPhone SE and so far so good. The launcher is something I usually replace first when I am using Android, but I didn't have to do that with this phone. So good I opted for the prime exclusive with ads. I received an awesome phone with 4 GB of RAM with little sacrifice. Thanks, Amazon!","rating":5},{"id":"RSORQNF2QMDO","title":"worth it for the $. can't beat it.","text":"cant beat it for the price. have the version with amazon adds and you barely notice it. worth the extra $60 off.in a nutshell for similar specs as say, a high end galaxy 7, you get a similar phone for 1/3 the price.I'm pretty impressed.note: I'm using Tmobile: carry over was super smooth. sim immediately recognized and 4g lte/volt booted up.tested a few calls was loud and clear. texting worked and got good wifi speeds in my home.","rating":5},{"id":"R15AM5FKGK9C06","title":"The camera, a main selling point, is way over-hyped.","text":"It's alright, but very disappointed in the over-hyped camera. Forget it without HDR and that is very slow. The cam tech sounds similar to what Google did with the last Nexus generation 5X/6P but indoor results are significantly worse despite those being released in 2015. Lots of phones take good shots in sunlight but indoors we take most photos of events and memories. This was the main reason to get the G5, so it will be returned.At this point the rest doesn't really matter, but I actually prefer quality plastic over metal (or glass!) on a phone. Thank you very much *bloggers*, for your tireless palaver about 'premium' feel... Anyway, to me the G5 looks and feels generic, but the grip was substantially better on a previous G I checked out a few years ago. Lastly I feel the overseas version with 3GB RAM, 32GB storage (plus SD card slot...) and NFC makes more sense than either of the G5 Plus versions offered in the US.","rating":3},{"id":"RBFKYZ7VXYGFR","title":"Phone is great except the Amazon app force closes upon launch","text":"Battery life is superb. Phone runs smoothly. Everything about this phone is great for a mid range budget phone, EXCEPT...THR BUILT IN AMAZON APP FOR THE PRIME EXCLUSIVE 2GB/32GB VERSION KEEPS CRASHING AND ONLY THAT APP REGARDLESS OF A FACTORY RESET!!!","rating":3},{"id":"R241N8EMS8M2L0","title":"Finger print scanner doesn't recognize print","text":"This is my 2nd moto g phone, my first one was a g4 plus that started to slow down and soon freeze or lock up on me which all started after I turbo charged it - it got so hot and I think it's messing around with the electronics... Now I just got this newer model the g5 plus and the finger print scanner doesn't capture my finger print and after the 5th try my phone then says use the pin so it's a good thing the pin option will unlock my phone.... 300.00 for a phone is still a lot of $$$ even for a budget phone... I ordered another g5 plus and will need to return this one....I'll update my review till when I get it...","rating":3}]
