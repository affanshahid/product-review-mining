Worth the price, however there are some things that could be better. So this is an in depth review of this refurbished iPhone 5S sold by Luuki_Luuki1. Overall Phone Condition:Like Brand New. Any other comments wont be necessary. This phone looks and feels like brand new. Cosmetically its 10/10.2. Packaging:Cheap. As you'd expect, this phone comes in a cheap aftermarket Chinese box, it looks OK, but far from high quality.3. Accessories:1 out of 5. Very very cheap charger, I wouldn't use that charger with my enemy's iPhone. Cable? Its OK but extremely short, probably 2 ft long.At this point I believe I purchased just a phone, accessories need to be purchased separately, since the ones that came with it are useless. However, phone looks great and works perfect. Phone costs 185$ which is not bad for a like new phone but make sure you spend another 30$ on a nice charger and cable for it.","rating":3},{"id":"R2AW04MIHOIVC0","title":"A great safe to purchase on Amazon phone.","text":"After reading reviews on other websites about refurbished phones I knew the best place to go was Amazon.  And Amazon came through for me offering this great refurbished phone along that this seller was certified to do quality work in refurbishing phones.  I have wanted an I phone for a long time aqnd the price of this phone can not be beat.  I had no problems with the phone, and It was unlocked just as they said.  It does not come with an instruction book so I watched how to set it up on UTube.and it made my eyes cross.  At this point I have to admit I am a sweet little old lady (at least I think I am) and going from android phones and tablets was a little unnerving.  I was so afraid I would set something up wrong.  and I did.  but eventually I realized my mistake.  I have 3 rotten middle age kids who just howled with laughter when I tried to get help from them.  But I showed them .... I am now using it with confidence (well almost).  I would recommend these refurbished phones to everyone.

I read reviews until my eyes were crossed and TECHarvard filled the bill.  In less than a week it was on my doorstep and it looked like new.  It has performed beautifully and I am thrilled to have made the decision both to buy an iPhone and to have purchased it from TECHarvard.

Of course it didn't work at all and since I had to send it all the way to Europe (at great expense) we were not able to return it within the time allowed.
