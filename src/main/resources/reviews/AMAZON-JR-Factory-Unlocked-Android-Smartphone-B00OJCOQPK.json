They are always asking to play Candy Crush or Talking Tom on our phones, so we decided to get them each one of their own. For the price, I thought this was a steal. After setting them up and trying to use them, I realized it was a robbery. Where my Note 3 takes a couple seconds to load Candy Crush, the Dash JR takes literally up to a full minute. Often times the kids would open it and just get some white screen. The market constantly crashed so downloading new games was impossible. I ended up returning them both and buying 2 of the Boost Mobile LG Volt. For $10 more each, I got a phone with Kit Kat (instead of Gingerbread which this phone runs), which has a much better front and rear camera (with flash), much faster processor, more RAM, much larger screen and everything works as expected.

I never could make a phone call because at best I had 1 bar and the call didn't go through.  I never managed to get a text through but I did get the email to work.  Unfortunately, I could only send emails if I was sitting within 5 feet of the router.  Oh yeah, there is the battery life.  There isn't any.  OK, I'm exaggerating.

You need a micro SD, which is nice it has one, but if you take it out and forget, you're screwed. The Play Store is too slow to actually work, I downloaded about 5-10 apps and it stopped working. It will attempt to download apps for 15 minutes and then say it had an error. I'm on a very powerful WiFi network, so this should not be happening. The web browser works, it's very slow, but my main phone is an s7 so it probably would run fast for the targeted audience. The screen is washed out, but I say as long as you can see the screen (which you can) it shouldn't make you buy a different phone. I'm not saying you should get the phone, considering it tried to die on day two from memory errors. It took about 10 minutes until it'd stop giving me warnings and actually let me delete apps.The cameras are okay, but they're better than what I expected for $30. The pictures are way too sharpened and the colors are a bit off. Every pic of the sky has made it a light purple.The texting app is total garbage. Every message comes in individually, just like a flip phone.

(I was afraid of losing my real phone). It was an utter disappointment.The layout and key function did not seem intuitive at all. I had an extremely hard time setting up and using Contacts.The texting feature is extremely clumsy. Despite promises of 'auto-fill' or 'suggestions' in the menu,this feature never worked.  So sending texts was cumbersome.When I made phone calls, I could hear fine, but the people I called said I was very hard to understand.So the mic quality on the phone is not so good. I thought I would fix this by using an external microphone/headset. However, I discovered that the jack at the top of the phone is ONLY for listening, so the microphone didn't work.I never could get internet access using my data plan.  And it has such a reduced operating system that the typical apps I wanted to install were incompatible with the phone. Too big..  The wifi on the phone worked well . But when I tried to use the phone as a hotspot (which it says it could do), it never worked.  Within a week of use, the power button stopped working properly so it was hard to get the phone to come on and stay on. Oh, and the camera quality is REALLY poor. Like ... really poor.  Really, the phone was a total disappointment.  I wish I'd just brought my iphone and chanced it.","rating":1},{"id":"R3P80GUQ5CSWH3","title":"Low internal memory","text":"Internal Memory collapses when installing the modern basic apps like Whatsapp, so basically we have a new age android sistem wich potential we cannot use due to this memory issue.
