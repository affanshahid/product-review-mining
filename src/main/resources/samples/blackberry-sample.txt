I am a lifetime Blackberry user. The PRIV is a good mix of Blackberry and Android and it has good tools for monitoring which programs are using what data, how much data, etc. Obviously, it has the keyboard, which is well made. Blackberry fans should like that. I am giving the phone a low rating, however, because the screen seems to be very fragile despite being advertised by BlackBerry and all its retailers as being made of very durable Corning Gorilla glass and having been \"rigorously drop tested.\" It's far more fragile than any other phone I've had, including other Blackberrys. If you look around online, you'll see myriad other users have had problems with the screen. In particular, minor impacts that would not damage the screen on another smartphone seem to shatter the PRIV's screen. Even this wouldn't be such a problem if a) reasonably priced parts were available for this easily replaceable screen or b) Blackberry and its retailers stood by Blackberry's claims about the screen's durability, which they do not. Finally, Blackberry customer service has been absolutely terrible so far both from a sales perspective and a support perspective.
